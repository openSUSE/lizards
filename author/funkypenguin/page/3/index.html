          <div class="entry">
            <p>Some may know about the Geeko&#8217;s Tube, I&#8217;m not so sure that many do though.  There has been for a while now <a title="openSUSE's Official video repository" href="http://tube.opensuse.org/">tube.opensuse.org</a>, this is the official repository of videos by openSUSE people.  All the video is in .ogg format, and as such will play straight out of the box regardless of whether users are purists/pragmatists/whatever.</p>
<p>There are several services out on the web that offer video streaming in flash, one that caught my attention is <a title="Blip online TV service" href="http://blip.tv">blip.tv</a>.  So why is blip different to YouTube et al?  Well for starters they openly use Open Source (they&#8217;re not ashamed of it), they support multiple formats for uploading and playback, and they provide multiple mechanisms to get your shows out there.</p>
<p>After some consultation on the mailing lists and IRC, I have created an openSUSE channel on blip.tv &#8211; <a title="openSUSE's Online TV channel" href="http://opensuse.blip.tv">http://opensuse.blip.tv</a> The aim is for videos by the openSUSE Community for the openSUSE Community can get uploaded there and reach a much wider audience.  There are only a few videos on there at the moment but the content will grow (I&#8217;m just having a few ISP issues over here :-/ ).  So what content is able to go on there?  The short answer is any, yes there are only a couple of catches: they must preferably be clean (remember the audience is varied from young to old), have an openSUSE twist (the whole reason for the channel).  At present there are a few screencasts and some presentations by community members at events (granted they&#8217;re all employees, but that doesn&#8217;t make them any less a member of our community).</p>
<p>Just to show some of the ways you can watch the channel:</p>
<p>Banshee (out of the box openSUSE 11.0 install)</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/watchingwithbanshee.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-113" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/watchingwithbanshee-300x230.png" alt="" width="300" height="230" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/watchingwithbanshee-300x230.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/watchingwithbanshee.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Browser (again out of the box openSUSE 11.0 install)</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/watchingwithbrowser.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-114" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/watchingwithbrowser-300x275.png" alt="" width="300" height="275" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/watchingwithbrowser-300x275.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/watchingwithbrowser.png 1189w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Free and Open Source video player/subscriber" href="http://www.getmiro.com/">Miro</a> which you can download, just look <a title="openSUSE-Community search showing Miro" href="http://packages.opensuse-community.org/index.jsp?searchTerm=miro&amp;distro=openSUSE_110">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/watchingwithmiro.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-115" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/watchingwithmiro-300x255.png" alt="" width="300" height="255" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/watchingwithmiro-300x255.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/watchingwithmiro.png 1118w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>As the channel is syndicated via RSS you can subscribe to it using Banshee/Miro and it will automatically download the latest episode for you (sorry I haven&#8217;t tried in KDE, but I believe it should work).  You can also add the RSS feed into your preferred reader and pull the attachments from there.</p>
<p>I would be really keen on getting people&#8217;s feedback and also if people have content they would like to get on there.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>So <a href="http://lugradio.org/live">LUG Radio Live</a> UK is over for another year, yes the event will be back next year but not the podcast.  openSUSE were represented by yours truly and <a href="http://disruptive.org.uk">Roger Whittaker</a> (also representing the Big N), and to be honest I didn&#8217;t have to get my baseball bat out once to get people to come by &#8211; I was slightly disappointed with that as knocking some sense into some of those Ubuntu zombies would have been fun 😛  Part of the reason may have been the fact that the Furry Geekos were out in force</p>
<p><img src="http://disruptive.org.uk/20080720.lrl/photos/7.jpg" alt="March of the Geekos" width="600" height="800" /></p>
<p>Roger also did a sterling job of getting the new openSUSE 11.0 Live/Installable DVD into almost all the &#8220;NutSacks&#8221; (The bags attendees received when entering the event).  Those that didn&#8217;t get one in there pretty quickly came over to ensure they did get one.  Everyone agreed that we had the best mascot and the best swag, talking of which can anyone guess what this is?</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3158/2690319494_d29223c3c9.jpg" alt="Mystery Swag" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Only a few folk were lucky enough to get one, and to be honest it is a much better one than what RedHat/Fedora were dishing out.  It is of course a USB stick</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3180/2689513347_40ba239fa6.jpg" alt="Mystery Swag Revealed" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Another piece of openSUSE swag that was being dished out but not by us was the Linux Magazine openSUSE 11.0 Special.  This is actually quite a good issue and is a great companion for anyone new to the distro.  I have a couple that I can send to people (UK/Europe preferably due to cost) if requested.  The issue was created aimed predominantly at the US market where Linux Magazine is trying to get a foot hold:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3032/2687602773_699bfa5ef0.jpg" alt="Linux Magazine openSUSE 11.0 Special Edition" width="375" height="500" /></p>
<p>Wandering around, I spoke to quite a lot of people about Linux in general and openSUSE and the feedback from people was tremendous.  Those that have actually tried 11.0 really really like it, and those that haven&#8217;t were adamant that they would.  So much so that one rather intimidating chap mentioned that <em>&#8220;A friend of mine needed to re-install her machine and she was very scared of the process, I gave her a DVD of 10.3 and told her to ring me if she was stuck.  She rang me a short while later and exclaimed at how easy and straight forward it was.  She hasn&#8217;t looked back since!&#8221;</em> The praise also came from a fair few die hards of other distros, which was pleasant to see and hear.  There was a friendly swag exchange with RedHat and Fedora, although their offering was pretty poor in comparison but still better than Ubuntu who had nothing but a type of crummy sticker and a million and one CDs of assorted variants of the same crud 🙂  The Fedora guys took it upon themselves to try and sully the image and spirit of our beloved Geeko by hanging it by one of their lanyards</p>
<p><img src="http://disruptive.org.uk/20080720.lrl/photos/35.jpg" alt="Hung Geeko" width="600" height="800" /></p>
<p>Thankfully the kind chaps from Debian rescued it, although I&#8217;m pretty sure it was for their own gains.  The atmosphere was light hearted and pleasent with no trolls in sight or in earshot.  This even extended to my lightning talk which was pretty well attended, around 30 people almost none of which were involved with openSUSE in any way.  You can get my slides <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/opensuse_freeingthelizard.pdf">here</a>, and there will be a video of it shortly.</p>
<p>All in all it was a fairly good weekend, and from an openSUSE perspective a very productive one 😉  I would like to thank Roger for his hard work in doing the stand, helping out and support as well as for the photos (some of which I used here).  I would also like to thank <a href="http://zonker.opensuse.org">Zonker</a> and Novell for arranging for the brilliant swag and DVDs, without which we could have looked like dull dorks.  Till next year!</p>

            <p>Yes peeps, this weekend is the penultimate <a href="http://lugradio.org">LUG Radio</a> <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/UK2008/start">show and event</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/230/480023477_8a690b9c72_m.jpg" alt="LRL Speaker" /></p>
<p>It is also an event where I will be speaking about the openSUSE project and its great community (yes there&#8217;ll be a bit about Novell and how good they are too 😉 )  You can see the full <a href="http://lugradio.org/live/UK2008/schedule">schedule</a> if you want to know what&#8217;s going on or just turn up on Sunday at 1500 to hear and see yours beautifully 😀</p>
<p>I am planning on being helping <a href="http://disruptive.org.uk/">Lord Whittaker</a> who will be there with a Novell stand, so hopefully I can bring a dash of Green Geeko Goodness to the event.  If you are planning on going, please say hello.  It&#8217;d be good to meet other openSUSE users.</p>

            <p>Those folk from the UK based Podcast <a title="Open Source Podcast" href="http://lugradio.org">LUG Radio</a> are holding their annual event <a title="The live LUG Radio" href="http://lugradio.org/live/UK2008/">LUG Radio Live</a> on July the 19th and 20th.  I am attending and hopefully presenting a talk on openSUSE and our great community, but I would also like to see openSUSE have some other presence there.  The only problem is that LRL isn&#8217;t one of the big Open Source events, and as such the project can&#8217;t justify the expense of sending employees to the event especially as a fair few of them went to the <a title="LUG Radio Live State Side" href="http://lugradio.org/live/USA2008/">US Show</a>.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m interested in knowing if there are any others going that would be interested in helping man a booth run by community members for the greater community?  If there are please let me know either by e-mailing the <a title="openSUSE Mailing List Directory " href="http://en.opensuse.org/Communicate/Mailinglists">Marketing Mailing list</a> or by commenting here.  Idealy we would need at least three people to man the booth, this way it would give people that are helping a chance to enjoy the event and not be shackled.</p>
<p>Please join in the fun and make sure people get the message that openSUSE is a real distro to contend with, this is an ideal opportunity for people who haven&#8217;t got much hacking prowess to help out 🙂</p>

            <p>Yet again the guardians of the garden are boogieing.</p>
<p>The <a title="openSUSE GNOME" href="http://en.opensuse.org/GNOME">GNOME Team</a> are holding their meeting tomorrow Thursday 22nd May at 1600GMT/UTC/ZULU (or <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=5&amp;day=22&amp;year=2008&amp;hour=16&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=0">translate</a> it into your local time).  As always you can get sight of the <a title="openSUSE GNOME meeting page" href="http://en.opensuse.org/GNOME/Meetings/">agenda</a>; the main themes for this week are Factory Testing, Bugs &#8211; under prioritised/bug voting/10.3 bug squashing, and a new item to the show Community Clinic.</p>
<p>&#8220;What pray tell is that last item?&#8221; I hear you ask (you did ask didn&#8217;t you?).  It is an item aimed at the code contributing challenged.  Basically we hope to be able to provide means for those that are unable to hack (for whatever reason) a way of helping out.  This could be packaging, documentation, pimping our wares and even <a title="High Altitude Low Opening" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HALO/HAHO">HALO</a> insertions behind enemy lines for guerrilla hit and run attacks.  Okay maybe not the last item but you get the idea.</p>
<p>So please come along and join the party, you don&#8217;t have to <a title="Bring Your Own Beer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byob">BYOB</a> but the more the merrier we become 😀</p>

            <p>So far from what I&#8217;ve heard and seen, people really like the upcoming 11.0 release &#8211; yes it is now only a month away 🙂</p>
<p>To try and make sure it is even better come release date the guys and gals need good bugreports, and preferably not duplicate bugs.  One handy tool for searching for your bug is <a href="http://mvidner.blogspot.com/2008/05/easier-bugzilla-search.html">Martin Vidner&#8217;s Bugzilla search tool</a>.  This has been formed into an <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Home">OpenSearch</a> plugin by the maestro that is <a href="http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/bweber">Benji</a>.</p>
<p>Basically all you need to do is head over to <a href="http://benjiweber.co.uk/bugzillasearch.html">here</a> and then select your search engine drop down menu and choose &#8220;Add openSUSE 11.0 Bug Search&#8221;.  I have tried it in FireFox 2 and 3, but Konqueror should be pretty much the same.</p>
<p>Thanks to Martin and Benji for this lovely facility, and now there is no excuse for not filing correct bug reports 😉 Happy bug hunting.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong><br />
Thanks again to Benji, he has corrected my mistake for adding the search option in Konqueror.  Just do the following:<br />
<em>settings -&gt; configure konqueror -&gt; web shortcuts -&gt; new</em><br />

            <p>Well, it&#8217;s more the ornaments of the garden having a discussion 🙂</p>
<p>The <a title="openSUSE GNOME" href="http://en.opensuse.org/GNOME">GNOME Team</a> are holding their meeting tomorrow Thursday 15th May at 1600GMT/UTC/ZULU (or <a title="Meeting time in your local time" href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=15&amp;month=5&amp;year=2008&amp;hour=16&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=0">translate</a> it into your local time).  As always you can get sight of the <a title="openSUSE GNOME meeting page" href="http://en.opensuse.org/GNOME/Meetings/">agenda</a>,the main themes for this week are <a title="PulseAudio @ GNOME.org" href="http://live.gnome.org/PulseAudio">PulseAudio</a>, <a title="PackageKit in 11.0" href="http://en.opensuse.org/PackageKit">PackageKit</a>, and installation patterns.</p>
<p>So if you have any suggestions, questions or complaints please join in on <a title="openSUSE GNOME's irc channel" href="irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-gnome">irc</a> and get you voice heard.  Remember we are a community that <em>like</em> to work together.  If you want to try and influence anything within openSUSE then don&#8217;t be passive and sit in the background grumbling, stand up and join in.  This goes for <strong>all</strong> aspects of openSUSE, not just GNOME.  We won&#8217;t bite, but we may disagree.  From that disagreement we can hopefully get to an amicable compromise, or at the very least explain the decisions that have been made.</p>
<p>So please join use tomorrow and try and make GNOME even better under openSUSE 🙂  As it happens the <a title="openSUSE KDE" href="http://en.opensuse.org/KDE">KDE Team</a> have their meeting today at 1800GMT/UTC/ZULU (<a title="Meeting time in your local time" href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=5&amp;day=14&amp;year=2008&amp;hour=18&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=0">translation</a> to local).</p>

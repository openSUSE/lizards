				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So last week many OpenStack (cloud software) developers met in Hongkong&#8217;s world expo halls to discuss the future development and show off what is done already.</p>
<p>Overall, I heard there were 3000 attendees, with 800 being developers or so. That sounds like a large number of people, but luckily everything felt well-organized and the rooms were always big enough to have seats for all interested.</p>
<p>The design sessions were usually pretty low-level and focused into one component, so it was not easy for me to make useful contributions in there. The session about <a href="http://icehousedesignsummit.sched.org/event/b683cd5cfcb3d812d8d1c899a87733b0">read-only API access</a> (e.g. for helpdesk workers and monitoring) and about HA were most useful to me.</p>
<p>In the breakout rooms were interesting sessions by many large OpenStack users (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClGsZsMFUkQ">CERN</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enmil7boIyI">Ebay</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HBaPEz68x0">Paypal</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QULq3-Ff4c">Dreamhost</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFGpWjSwr_0">Rackspace</a>) giving valuable insights into what people expect from and do with a cloud. Many of them are using custom-built parts, because the plain OpenStack <a href="https://plus.google.com/108928462394474625418/posts/NsqXDVErLtj">is still not complete</a> to run a cloud. SUSE Cloud ships with some such missing parts (e.g. deployment and configuration management), but most organisations seem to run their own at the moment.</p>
<p>Cloudbase was there telling about their Hyper-V support that we integrated in SUSE Cloud.<br />
Apart from the 6 SUSE Cloud developers there were several local (and one Australian) SUSE guys manning the booth.</p>
<p>Overall it was quite some experience to be there (in such an exotic and yet nice place) and listen and talk to so many different people from very different backgrounds.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you run data-driven applications like me, you are probably already running some kind of backup and have plans for disaster recovery. I hope you are not still using SQL dumps?</p>
<p>I have been using <a href="http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/" target="_blank">Percona XtraBackup</a> professionally for MySQL backups for a while now. Especially if your database access is highly transactional you will find it useful that you can get consistent non-blocking, non-purging backups while continuing to serve transactions. Who wants downtime anyway?</p>
<p>Under the hood the software will take a dirty copy of the InnoDB tablespaces on disk, and extract binary logs required to bring all of these to a specific point in time, or rather LSN, using a patched version of the mysqld binary. The preparation / restore requires applying the binary log to the files which results in MySQL tablespaces and binary log files equivalent to how they would have been with a clean MySQL shutdown.</p>
<p>Mixing transactional with non-transactional database engines is possible if you are willing to accept some blocking time while backing them up. If you are using MySQL replication, you can also use this to create a new slave from either a master or to clone a slave from another without downtime of either.</p>
<p>The upgrade to the 2.0 series adds, among other things, parallel IO and parallel compression. This requires a new streaming file format <a href="http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/xbstream/xbstream.html" target="_blank">xbstream</a> in addition the previous tar. Think of it as a tar with multiple input pipes.</p>
<p>I added the <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/xtrabackup" target="_blank">xtrabackup package</a> to openSUSE, it is available in the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?project=server%3Adatabase&amp;package=xtrabackup" target="_blank">server:database project</a> (<a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/database/" target="_blank">repo</a>, <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/AndreasStieger:/xtrabackup-SLE/" target="_blank">SLE 11</a>) right now and will also be part of the next openSUSE release.</p>
<p>Remember that these are only tools. Love your data and protect your business. A copy is not a backup. A backup that isn&#8217;t monitored for success is not a backup. A backup that is not proven to restore successfully is <em>barely</em> a backup.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:AndreasStieger" target="_blank">Contact me</a> if you need help setting this up.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, came across <a title="x2go home" href="http://x2go.org">x2go</a> packages maintained by<a title="People of openSUSE" href="http://news.opensuse.org/2009/04/23/people-of-opensuse-jan-engelhardt/"> Jan Engelhardt</a> for openSUSE and other distributions on <a title="X11:RemoteDesktop:x2go" href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=X11:RemoteDesktop:x2go">open build service</a>. As <a title="Li-f-e" href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e">openSUSE Education Li-f-e</a> has great <a title="LTSP home" href="http://ltsp.org">LTSP</a> integration thanks to<a title="KIWI-LTSP on openSUSE wiki" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI-LTSP"> KIWI-LTSP</a>, I decided to check out how x2go can fit in with this existing thin-client computing solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;x2go is an open (<acronym title="GNU General Public License">GPL</acronym>/AGPL) source “server based computing” project. Combining the advantages of existing systems it features ease of use, performance and scalability. x2go provides you with access to your desktop &#8211; from within your own network and via the internet. x2go is not limited to particular hardware, it supports a variety of devices and architectures.&#8221; -from their website.</p>
<p>Some of the features/benefits of x2go that are not available on LTSP are:</p>
<p>* Remote login from within local lan and internet from any OS<br />
* Session persistence, you can disconnect session from one client and continue where you left off from any other client<br />
* Low bandwidth usage<br />
* Session sharing with other users<br />
<span id="more-9029"></span><br />
Apart from these, x2go also supports sound redirection via pulseaudio, folder sharing for access to local disks similar to LTSP.</p>
<p>I would personally still prefer LTSP session in local network, and as x2goserver and LTSP server can coexist on same server we can choose x2goclient to connect over the internet and log in using LTSP in local lan.</p>
<p>Here is how to run x2go as kiosk session by PXE booting a thin-client/PC/laptop.</p>
<p>* Install <a title="kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go" href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go">kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go</a> on openSUSE Edu Li-f-e or 12.2 via <a title="Install via 1-click" href="http://software.opensuse.org/ymp/server:ltsp/openSUSE_12.2/kiwi-ltsp-profile-x2go.ymp">1-click from here</a>.<br />
* Run <code>kiwi-ltsp -ln openSUSE_12_2_x2go</code> as root to create KIWI-LTSP image that is used for PXE booting clients, (this step requires fast internet connection and about 250M download)<br />
* Run <code>kiwi-ltsp -c</code> to configure required services<br />
* Add the following to<strong><em> /srv/tftpboot/KIWI/root.default/etc/lts.conf</strong></em>  under [default] for all clients or under [MA:CA:DD:RE:SS] for a particular client and boot up the client, openSUSE_12_2_x2go will be available at the end of boot menu.<br />
<code><br />
        SCREEN_07=kiosk<br />
        KIOSK_EXE="/usr/bin/x2goclient --no-menu --maximize --link=lan --geometry=fullscreen --thinclient --haltbt --no-session-edit  --add-to-known-hosts"<br />
        KIOSKUSER=x2goclient<br />
 </code></p>
<p>You can also have normal LTSP session on tty8 along with this by adding <code>SCREEN_08=ldm</code>. To connect to the server from non-thin-client install and run x2goclient.</p>
<p>You can simply poweroff the client without the need to disconnect or do normal shutdown.</p>
<p>Note: this method of using x2go is just for testing and development purpose, you can use x2goserver and x2goclient in a standalone mode without kiwi-ltsp bits. Nothing additional than installing x2goserver package is needed to setup the server, except firewall should allow access to ssh port(22). </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With openSUSE 12.2 almost here, we have been working hard to get <a title="Check out their cool new site" href="http://www.ltsp.org/" target="_blank">LTSP</a> experience on this release better than ever. Thanks to the power of <a title="KIWI imaging technology" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI" target="_blank">KIWI </a>and some great scripting by Alex Savin, <a title="KIWI-LTSP on openSUSE wiki" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI-LTSP" target="_blank">KIWI-LTSP</a> has a lot of new features and improvements.</p>
<p>Here is how to get started:</p>
<p><span id="more-8949"></span></p>
<p>* Install <a title="openSUSE 12.2 RC2" href="http://software.opensuse.org/developer/en" target="_blank">openSUSE 12.2</a> (preferably 32bit version)</p>
<p>* Install all the required packages via this <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/ltsp/openSUSE_12.2/kiwi-ltsp-prebuilt-testing.ymp" target="_blank">1-click install</a> (about 200MB download)</p>
<p>* Configure network by following <a title="Network configuration for LTSP" href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KIWI-LTSP_network_configuration" target="_blank">this guide</a></p>
<p>* Once the network is configured, open terminal and run this as root user (run &#8220;su -&#8221; to become root user)</p>
<p><code>kiwi-ltsp -c</code></p>
<p>The above command will configure all the required services like dhcpd, tftp for pxeboot, nfs/aoe/nbd servers for root, now you can boot up any PC/laptop/thin client using PXE(network booting) connected to the server. The clients would be able to use all the softwares installed on the server without their hard disk modified. The server would require about 256MB RAM per client, and ideally minimum 512MB RAM on the client, disable IO/CPU intensive or plain annoying services  like tracker, apper/PackageKit, nepomuk, strigi etc. for best performance.</p>
<p>New features:</p>
<p>Although the default prebuilt image connects to the server and all the processes are run on the server, with more powerful clients some of the load can be run client side by the use of ltsp-localapps. IceWM, firefox(with all the plugins that are installed on the server if the server is 32bit) and xterm are part of the default image, if you want something more  like VOIP clients: ekiga/twinkle for example you can clone the default image and customize it as per your requirements.</p>
<p><code>kiwi-ltsp --list-profiles    #Show list of available images profiles<br />
kiwi-ltsp --clone  suse-12.2 new_profile  #Clone existing profile </code></p>
<p>You can then edit kiwi&#8217;s image description in<em><strong> /srv/kiwi-profiles/new_profile/img/config.xml</strong></em> or<strong><em><em> /etc/sysconfig/kiwi-ltsp</em></em></strong> <strong>LTSP_LOCALAPPS=&#8221;ekiga mypackage&#8221;</strong> to add required packages in the image. You can also use local i686 DVD iso as installation source by adding <strong>suse_1220_INSTALL_SOURCE=/path/to/iso</strong> there.</p>
<p><code>kiwi-ltsp -l</code> will build the clicfs image that will be used to boot up clients, <code>kiwi-ltsp -c</code> will add the profile to the PXE boot menu also.</p>
<p>To customize the image manually you can chroot into the image:<br />
<code>kiwi-ltsp --chroot new_profile</code> do your modifications and run <code>kiwi-ltsp -l2 new_profile</code> to build compressed image from your modified tree. Check out <code>kiwi-ltsp -h</code> to see all that this utility can do.</p>
<p>Complete desktop environments like GNOME/KDE can be installed in the image to be served over the network to more powerful clients(1-2GB RAM on the client), using <strong>LTSP_FATCLIENT=True</strong> in <em><strong>/srv/tftpboot/KIWI/root.default/etc/lts.conf</strong></em> will allow the whole session to run on local client hardware, hard disk is not used of course, so normal booting will get to whatever is installed on the disk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When people want to provide a collection of files, they sometimes choose to do so by providing a .iso image file. But if you only want to look what files are in there or only need a few files, e.g. kernel and initrd for PXE-booting, you still had to download the whole thing to loop-mount it.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t have to anymore. Because modern web servers support delivering only parts of a file (using the &#8220;Range&#8221; header field), that allowed me to implement curlwwwfs that mounts remote HTTP directories into your local filesystem. And then you can use fuseiso on top to access the actual content within the .iso. All without root access.</p>
<p>This is how it works:</p>
<p>First you have to install the required packages (replace 12.2 with your version of openSUSE (or if you use a different Linux distribution, do git clone git://github.com/bmwiedemann/curlwwwfs and &#8220;make install&#8221; in there)):</p>
<p>zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/bmwiedemann/openSUSE_12.2/home:bmwiedemann.repo</p>
<p>zypper in curlwwwfs fuseiso</p>
<p># Then you start it:</p>
<p>mkdir mnthttp mntiso</p>
<p>curlwwwfs http://zq1.de/bootcd mnthttp &amp;</p>
<p>ls -la mnthttp/</p>
<p>fuseiso mnthttp/bmwinux-8.2-040808.iso mntiso</p>
<p>cat mntiso/isolinux/isolinux.cfg</p>
<p># and later you clean it up with</p>
<p>fusermount -u mntiso</p>
<p>fusermount -u mnthttp</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I work on automatic testing of one of our products that creates other projects.<br />
And because there is a lot of clouds everywhere I want to use them too. We<br />
have internally an OpenStack cloud (still Diablo release). So I need to solve<br />
  automatic uploading of images built in the Build Service. Below I describe my working version.</p>
<p><span id="more-8635"></span></p>
<p>At first, for other cloud related tasks we are using the <tt>nova</tt> command (which<br />
e.g. has also <tt>image-delete</tt>, but not <tt>add</tt>).  For uploading we use<br />
<tt>glance</tt>. I found a few obstacles which I separately describe and also provide<br />
a solution.</p>
<h4>Authentication</h4>
<p>The first chalenge is authentication, as glance doesn`t use <TT>NOVA_*</TT><br />
environment variables. But it allows to use an authentication token. So we<br />
just need to get such a token. With help of Martin Vidner we have this script,<br />
  that returns a valid token.</p>
<blockquote><pre># cloud_auth_token.sh
OS_AUTH_URL="http://cloud.example.com:5000/v2.0"
OS_TENANT_NAME=$NOVA_USERNAME
OS_USERNAME=$NOVA_USERNAME
OS_PASSWORD=$NOVA_API_KEY
AUTH_JSON="{\"auth\":{\"passwordCredentials\":{\"username\": \"$OS_USERNAME\", \"password\":\"$OS_PASSWORD\"}, \"tenantName\":\"$OS_TENANT_NAME\"}}"
curl -s \
    -d "$AUTH_JSON" -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    $OS_AUTH_URL/tokens \
    | python -c "import sys; import json; tok = json.loads(sys.stdin.read()); print tok['access']['token']['id'];"</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>What does it do? It calls OpenStack Identity API, passes credentials encoded<br />
as JSON. The response is also JSON, so we use python that is already on the<br />
system to parse the response and get the token.</p>
<h4>Compressing the Image</h4>
<p>The next challenge is compression of the image. We get a raw disk from the<br />
  build service and we extend it to have more than 15GB (we mirror there rpms<br />
  so we need this space). For resizing we use <tt>qemu-img</tt> from<br />
  virt-utils. If we simply upload this image it means that we send the whole<br />
  15GB over the network. Which is fine for one-time tasks, but for regular<br />
  testing it is a problem. Thanks to Christoph Thiel we solved it with the<br />
  conversion to qcow2. Qcow2 is also supported in OpenStack and qcow2 allows<br />
  compression. The final script for conversion:</p>
<blockquote><pre>qemu-img convert -c -f raw -O qcow2 img.raw img.qcow2
qemu-img resize img.qcow2 +10G</pre>
</blockquote>
<h4>Using it Together</h4>
<p>Now we have prepared an image and a helper script to get a cloud auth<br />
  token. So let&#8217;s upload the image.</p>
<blockquote><pre>cat img.qcow2 | glance -H cloud.example.com -A `sh cloud_auth_token.sh` add name='testing_img' is_public=False disk_format=qcow2 container_format=bare</pre>
</blockquote>
<h4>Cleaning Up After Testing</h4>
<p>We use it for testing and release new versions of the testing appliance often,<br />
  therefore we need cleaning up. It is quite simple with unix text utils:</p>
<blockquote><pre>for i in `nova image-list | grep "image_name" | sed "s/^|[[:space:]]\+\([[:xdigit:]-]\+\).*$/\1/"`; do nova image-delete $i; done</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope that it helps you with automatic uploading of images to<br />
  OpenStack. It works for me with the Diablo release and there is no guarantee that it is the best way <img src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m pleased to introduce you to a new available package for postgreSQL database.<br />
The R procedural language extension developed by Joseph E Conway.</p>
<h2>R Procedural Language for PostgreSQL</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>PL/R is a library which allow you to add the power of R statistical engine in your database.<br />
This article will show you how to add it and basic usage on a 12.1 installation.<br />
(The package is also available for 11.4)</p>
<p>Become familiar with the project and how it can help you.<br />
The homepage project  : <a href="http://www.joeconway.com/plr/">www.joeconway.com/plr/</a></p>
<p>We admit here, that you are able to manage a posgreSQL server instance, and have already one running.<br />
<span id="more-8597"></span></p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Actually the pre-packaged rpms are available at<br />
Repository for openSUSE 12.1: </p>
<p>http://software.opensuse.org/repositories/server:database:postgresql/openSUSE_12.1</p>
<p>Repository for openSUSE 11.4: </p>
<p>http://software.opensuse.org/repositories/server:database:postgresql/openSUSE_11.4</p>
<p>Packages are composed of postgresql-plr (containing only the necessary lib) and postgresql-plr-doc (the whole documentation and samples)</p>
<h4 style="color:red">Disclaimer/Warning</h4>
<p>This repository is the devel (but stable) repository for postgresql, using it can ask you to upgrade your postgresql installation to new version.<br />
Take care to be sure, you can safely upgrade it (backups before), other software you need that are linked to previous version etc&#8230;</p>
<p>Submission to factory/12.2 is pending &#8230;</p>
<p>Adding the repository</p>
<pre>
zypper ar -f -c -n "server-database-postgresql" http://software.opensuse.org/repositories/server:database:postgresql/openSUSE_12.1 "server-database-postgresql"
</pre>
<p>If postgresql is already installed<br />
Check upgrade process </p>
<pre>
zypper -v dup -D -r server-database-postgresql
</pre>
<p>Do the upgrade </p>
<pre>
zypper -v dup -r server-database-postgresql
</pre>
<p>Add postgresql-plr to the installation</p>
<pre>
zypper in postgresql-plr postgresql-plr-doc
</pre>
<h3>Create a PLR ready database</h3>
<p>As postgresql superuser </p>
<pre>
createdb plrtest
</pre>
<p>Create the plr extension</p>
<pre>psql -d plrtest</pre>
<pre>CREATE EXTENSION plr;</pre>
<p>Quick test if it works</p>
<pre>
-- first, define the language and functions.  Turn off echoing so that expected file
-- does not depend on contents of plr.sql.
--
\set ECHO none
-- check version
SELECT plr_version();

 plr_version 
-------------
 08.03.00.13
(1 row)
</pre>
<h3>Work with</h3>
<p>If you install the package postresql-plr-doc you will have a file named plr.out which contain a lot of usefull examples.</p>
<p>Connect to your plr ready db</p>
<pre>psql -d plrtest</pre>
<p>And run some of the example like </p>
<pre>
--
-- test aggregates
--
create table foo(f0 int, f1 text, f2 float8) with oids;
insert into foo values(1,'cat1',1.21);
insert into foo values(2,'cat1',1.24);
insert into foo values(3,'cat1',1.18);
insert into foo values(4,'cat1',1.26);
insert into foo values(5,'cat1',1.15);
insert into foo values(6,'cat2',1.15);
insert into foo values(7,'cat2',1.26);
insert into foo values(8,'cat2',1.32);
insert into foo values(9,'cat2',1.30);
create or replace function r_median(_float8) returns float as 'median(arg1)' language 'plr';
select r_median('{1.23,1.31,1.42,1.27}'::_float8);
 r_median 
----------
     1.29
(1 row)

CREATE AGGREGATE median (sfunc = plr_array_accum, basetype = float8, stype = _float8, finalfunc = r_median);
select f1, median(f2) from foo group by f1 order by f1;
  f1  | median 
------+--------
 cat1 |   1.21
 cat2 |   1.28
(2 rows)

create or replace function r_gamma(_float8) returns float as 'gamma(arg1)' language 'plr';
select round(r_gamma('{1.23,1.31,1.42,1.27}'::_float8)::numeric,8);
   round    
------------
 0.91075486
(1 row)

CREATE AGGREGATE gamma (sfunc = plr_array_accum, basetype = float8, stype = _float8, finalfunc = r_gamma);
select f1, round(gamma(f2)::numeric,8) from foo group by f1 order by f1;
  f1  |   round    
------+------------
 cat1 | 0.91557649
 cat2 | 0.93304093
(2 rows)

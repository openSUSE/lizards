          <div class="entry">
            <p>In my last blog I was mentioning the &#8220;Distribution Wettstreit&#8221; which translates in &#8220;distribution competition&#8221; held on the Chemnitzer Linuxtage event.  The idea of that session is to have distros lined up on stage and give them a task and see how each of them is able to solve it and compare that.  I participated for openSUSE but the session left some question marks for me. Here are my thoughts how the idea could be improved.</p>
<p>As far as I know it happened the second time in Chemnitz, were Debian, Fedora, Mandriva, Pardus, Ubuntu and openSUSE were on stage. The tasks we got were every day problems, such as playing a flash movie or how to display a html 5 page. openSUSE was lucky with a one week old release, so wonder why we can handle HTML5 directly and others who released earlier can not? </p>
<div id="attachment_6883" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/apples_oranges.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/apples_oranges-300x220.jpg" alt="Apples and Oranges" title="apples_oranges" width="300" height="220" class="size-medium wp-image-6883" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/apples_oranges-300x220.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/apples_oranges.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Apples and Oranges</p></div>
<p>I have to say that I do not like this kind of session too much. It is great to compare distributions, and also to do it kind of interactively and live. But even given that all involved know that its not about finding a winner and a looser, in this format there are too many parameters that influence the whole thing: First, the release date. Younger distros tend to be better than older ones. Second, it highly depends on the person who sits in front of the machine and explains what he does to solve the problem. One must be able to solve the task technically, and than she/he must be able to talk about it appealingly.</p>
<p>Different distros target at different user groups, and you quickly compare apples with oranges. I think it should be realized as a benefit that we&#8217;re different, and that does not necessarily need to end up in a competition everywhere. Moreover, we should appreciate if people remain playful and try distros as they like instead of trying to nail them to one forever.</p>
<p>Maybe next time we can rather have a <em>&#8220;The combined power of the Linux variety&#8221; </em>-session [working title] instead? In that we could try to work out the differences between the distros and which user groups could benefit from them. I mean, the variety in the FOSS community is the great  advantage that we have over other systems and we should express it. And our similarities which we certainly have should also be brought on the table. To whom do we really compete? I guess we should be compared against commercial systems which tend to lock the user in with huge consequences or have security-, innovation- and other issues. Why not line up on stage and show the audience how we together beat these system with free software in various ways for the good of the user?</p>
<p>Yes, playing flash movies is a every users problem, and I know the <em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, it simply needs to work!&#8221;</em>-attitude lots of users do have. We as free software distributions had and have to find ways to deal with it, and we all have our solutions. But whats really important is not to present new users that we even though in general can not work with Flash, we found a workaround. </p>
<p>The more important message is why its dark in some corners of FOSS world, how that can be improved and who is able to change that. I think it would be awesome if that could be taken more into account the next time we have the opportunity to speak to such an audience as distributions together.</p>

            <p>Last weekend I spent on <a href="http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2011/">Chemnitzer Linuxtage 2011</a> which is a popular linux event in Chemnitz, Germany. It was the first time I have been there and was very positively surprised. It is a very well organised event, in a building providing the perfect environment and a large amount of volunteers helping to make the whole weekend enjoyable and relaxed. Thanks for that, it really was fun to meet so many people in this all-inclusive atmosphere :o)</p>
<p><img src="http://robert.fedorapeople.org/events/2011/chemnitzer-linux-tage/024.jpg"/>openSUSE had a booth there (thanks Fedora for the picture) and we were lucky enough to have brand new 11.4 promo DVDs there which were handed to interested people. openSUSE 11.4 in general is very well received at most visitors, they were quite happy with our latest release. That is also true for the feelings for openSUSE all over: I heard so much positive feedback about what we do and how we do it, for example the OBS with the collaboration features, the distribution or the activity all over. People recognize our efforts.</p>
<p>I gave a talk about <a href="http://volle-kraft-voraus.de">Kraft</a>, as people hinted me that there might be the right audience for the topic of Linux in the small business. The interest was huge, the room was more than full and people seemed to like the way I was approaching the challenge. Unfortunately I had to fight with the notebook/beamer phalanx in the beginning (I apologize for that) so that I had to skip the live demo of Kraft in the end. But still I got a lot of interesting discussions afterwards and got some nice contributions already. Thanks for that. </p>
<p>On saturday noon there was a &#8220;Distribution competition&#8221; where I was pulled in to show openSUSE. It went ok for all distros taking part and was fun for us presenting 🙂</p>
<p>Booster Michal was giving a workshop about creating packages in the OBS for  multiple distributions and a very well received &#8220;whats new in 11.4?&#8221; talk was given by Sirko in the beginners track. </p>
<p>It was a great event, even though I quite exhausted arrived home late on sunday night. I will be there next year again.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I like to suggest a general policy for openSUSE:Factory project to document from where a tar ball (or any other file from upstream) is comming from. Why that ? It makes it much easier to review version updates and it guarantees that no one can inject some mal code via a modifed tar ball.</p>
<p>So far I added the source services &#8220;download_url&#8221; and &#8220;tar_scm&#8221; to our OBS instance, which downloads the files and stores them as files via a commit. Some people use them already, some others don&#8217;t like them because they store the files with _service: prefix.</p>
<p>In last hackweek, I added another way to handle this, which I would like to request as setup and policy for openSUSE:Factory project. You can add a project wide source service, for example the new &#8220;download_files&#8221; service. That would mean that no needs to add a _service file to the sources anymore. It is enough to add an URL to the spec file Source: tags. The service will automatically download it from there.</p>
<p>But that does mean we still have have _service:download_files:osc-0.1.tar.bz2 file names ? Not when we also add the new &#8220;trylocal&#8221; parameter and use latest osc versions. This parameter will let act osc to execute the services, but name the files without prefix and commit them together with the other files.</p>
<p>Where is the advantage then ? The server is still validating that this is an identical file. It downloads it again and compares it. In case it is the same file, nothing will happen.</p>
<p>What will happen, when the file differes ? We basically have two options, either we can let the service mark the source as broken or we would store the file with _service: prefix again.</p>
<p>The later mode has the advantage that you can still do version upgrades via slow connections and let the server download the files.</p>
<p>Please find some more details about new possibilities with the source services <a href="http://doc.opensuse.org/products/draft/OBS/obs-reference-guide/cha.obs.source_service.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>An example setup for this can be tested via </p>
<p><code>osc bco home:adrianSuSE:FactoryTest bc</code></p>
<p>and do for example a version downgrade to 1.05 version to see how it works. Please note that you need the osc from openSUSE:Tools:Unstable project for this.</p>
<p>We can also apply the still suse-internal spec formater and validator scripts via this way later one.</p>
<p>Another advantage of this setup would be the new &#8220;update_source&#8221; service, which could run in some openSUSE:Factory:AutoUpdate project and tries automatic version upgrades when upstream releases a new version. They could be reviewed and just picked (directly or with additional manual fixes). </p>

            <p>We had this week a discussion on IRC on how to name the next release and I took the action item to do a poll on connect.opensuse.org now to help us solve the naming of openSUSE distribution releases. I&#8217;ve started earlier today a discussion on the opensuse-project list and already incorporated some comments I received in this text.</p>
<p>openSUSE does not have a major and minor numbering, even if it seems so. There is right now no difference in any way between what we would do for openSUSE 11.4 or 12.0 &#8211; and no sense to speak about openSUSE 11 or openSUSE 11 family. We also have no process on how to name the next release (when to increase which parts of the number).</p>
<p>Here are some options, if I miss some, please tell me and I will then soon setup a poll. I&#8217;m listening the next version we would use as well as how the following would be called as an example. Remember we have releases every 8 months, so the next releases will be in:<br />
November 2011, July 2012, March 2013, November 2013, July 2014, March 2015.</p>
<p>Here are the options I collected so far:</p>

            <p>Not that I know a lot about Artwork or Wallpapers&#8230; For those, I am mainly a &#8216;customer&#8217; most of the times, and things get easy for&#8230; either I like it, or I don&#8217;t. There&#8217;s a lot of stuff available out there, and initially I loved the snake (I still do), but since I couldn&#8217;t distribute it due to licensing, I&#8217;ve spent a couple of hours looking for Artwork with a compatible license and contacted a few artists about licensing and the possibility of using/distributing their work.</p>
<p>To distribute for GNOME:Ayatana on the 11.4 cycle, I&#8217;m going to use &#8216;Spaceman Goldrush Edition&#8217; from &#8216;mydarktime&#8217;, a German artist. I&#8217;m happy that mydarktime has been so kind in allowing openSUSE to distribute this package under CC-BY-SA. I will also take the opportunity to quote him:</p>
<p>&#8220;(&#8230;)  I would be very pleased to see mine in it&#8221; (wallpaper pack on GNOME:Ayatana).</p>
<p>I find this wallpaper very attractive and it doesn&#8217;t really tire me up from looking at it, which is really, really nice! I hope everyone else likes it also!</p>

            <p>Updated : April 4th 2011</p>
<h2>Preambule : free software</h2>
<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>I would notice everybody which will install these software : you will install proprietary softwares on your computer. Nobody will be able to debug them, nor help you to resolve what can be happen. That must be said !</p>
<h3>The free future</h3>
<p>The real future is already in place : it&#8217;s called radeon (or free-radeon), it&#8217;s fully integrated in kernel &amp; xorg. Actually ( for openSUSE 11.4, or openSUSE 11.3 with <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Kernel:/stable/openSUSE_11.3/">kernel-stable</a> + <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/XOrg/openSUSE_11.3/">X11 obs repo</a> ). Support for many chipset is in real progress even for the 6xxx series.<br />
Give it a try before using the proprietary software, report any bugs you find with it. Only your contributions can help and will make a real differences. Thanks for doing that !</p>
<h2>Unofficial but working repository</h2>
<p>I offer for those of you that for any reasons can&#8217;t use successfully the free-radeon drivers a repository where you will find the latest fglrx/catalyst drivers following the packaging policy made avalaible by AMD.<br />
Thanks to Sebastian Siebert ( check his blog ) to work in coordination with ati/amd and follow the catalyst packaging. His work allow us to have that driver available for openSUSE.</p>
<h3>The quick how-to</h3>
<h4>Adding the repository</h4>
<h5>For openSUSE Factory</h5>
<pre style="font-size:x-small">
zypper ar -c -f -n "ATI/AMD fglrx non-official" http://linux.ioda.net/mirror/ati/openSUSE_Factory/ "ATI/AMD FGLRX"
</pre>
<h5>For openSUSE 11.4</h5>
<pre style="font-size:x-small">
zypper ar -c -f -n "ATI/AMD fglrx non-official" http://linux.ioda.net/mirror/ati/openSUSE_11.4/ "ATI/AMD FGLRX"
</pre>
<h5>For openSUSE 11.3</h5>
<pre style="font-size:x-small">
zypper ar -c -f -n "ATI/AMD fglrx non-official" http://linux.ioda.net/mirror/ati/openSUSE_11.3/ "ATI/AMD FGLRX"
</pre>
<h5>For openSUSE 11.2</h5>
<pre style="font-size:x-small">
zypper ar -c -f -n "ATI/AMD fglrx non-official" http://linux.ioda.net/mirror/ati/openSUSE_11.2/ "ATI/AMD FGLRX"
</pre>
<h4>Installing the driver</h4>
<h5>Nota previous version</h5>
<p>Due to change in ati/amd way of life, it&#8217;s recommanded to completely remove any version of fglrx previously installed with a zypper rm </p>
<p>I can only recommand to also (as root) </p>
<pre style="font-size:x-small">
# Remove old conf &amp; stuff
rm -fr /etc/ati
# Remove any old fglrx inside kernel modules
find /lib/modules -type f -iname "fglrx.ko" -exec rm -fv {} \;
</pre>
<h5>New installation</h5>
<p>Once the repo has been added, you will certainly have to reboot to get ride off free radeon module. At boot on  the grub line add<br />
nomodeset blacklist=radeon 3<br />
Don&#8217;t panic you will be land to a console, open it with root account to install fglrx.<br />
Search the software you want for example under openSUSE 11.4 </p>
<pre style="font-size:x-small">
zypper se -s fglrx

So use that one. I&#8217;ve removed all non xpic drivers the 2 April 2011.</p>
<h5>For a 64bits version</h5>
<pre style="font-size:x-small">zypper in fglrx64_xpic_SUSE114</pre>
<h5>For a 32bits version</h5>
<pre style="font-size:x-small">zypper in fglrx_xpic_SUSE114</pre>
<p>During the installation process, all the dependencies will be added, which mostly are needed to build the kernel modules. Expect around 200MB to dowload.</p>
<p>Then the installer will build the module for your installed kernel.<br />
And if there&#8217;s a kernel update, the script will automagically detect that, and will rebuild the module for the new kernel installed. (So if you find that your workstation is slow on reboot just press the esc key to see the details &#8230; )</p>
<h4>Preparing xorg to use fglrx</h4>
<p>Once the module is build and installed, you should have a file fglrx.conf or 50-fglrx.conf in /etc/modprobe.d </p>
<pre style="font-size:x-small">cat /etc/modprobe.d/50-fglrx.conf
blacklist radeon
</pre>
<p>Next ati recommend to use ati &#8211;initial-config but that break the auto-detect stack of xorg. So I recommend changing one line in file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-device.conf<br />
just change driver line to <strong> driver &#8220;fglrx&#8221;</strong><br />
All the rest of the setup (double screen etc) will be made lately with the ati catalyst control center (command is amdcccle).<br />
For those of you which want to have an xorg.conf file just have a look at aticonfig &#8211;help command.</p>
<h5>Start X</h5>
<p>If you are inside the console we start to use before just run &#8220;init 5&#8221; to start xorg, and normally you will find your normal xorg login screen (kdm, gdm, ldm, xdm).<br />
Hit ctrl+alt+f1 to return to the console and type exit or logout or ctrl+d to close it.<br />
then ctrl+alt+f7 to return to the xorg session.</p>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>ati/amd catalyst are release on a month basis, but this vary from 3 weeks to 8 weeks.</p>

Dear followers, after the <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2011/02/03/join-us-for-the-first-virtual-launch-party-opensuse-11-4/">official announcement</a>, we test yesterday the place, and check how fun and cool it can be with several attendees.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/DJ-Britt.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/DJ-Britt-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6640" /></a>The danse party Pop/Rock music themed was animated by DJ Yazz (Brittany Haefeli). Starting at 8:30 CEST the party was crowded during it&#8217;s 2 hours and a half. More than 50 people came and visit us during that time. Great that was twice what we expected !<br />

<p>I would like to have feedback about how that works for you, please comment !</p>
<p><h2>Factory specifics troubles</h2>
<p> on a fresh auto-configuration factory install : libomp43 </p>
<pre>
Problem: fglrx64_7_6_0_SUSE114-8.812-1.x86_64 requires gcc, but this requirement cannot be provided
  uninstallable providers: gcc-4.5-16.1.i586[openSUSE-11.4-11.4-1.35]
                   gcc-4.5-16.1.x86_64[openSUSE-11.4-11.4-1.35]
 Solution 1: deinstallation of libgomp43-4.3.4_20091019-5.23.x86_64
 Solution 2: do not install fglrx64_7_6_0_SUSE114-8.812-1.x86_64
 Solution 3: break fglrx64_7_6_0_SUSE114 by ignoring some of its dependencies

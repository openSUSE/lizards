				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The LibYUI framework brings enormous advantage when you need an application which can be used with X and ncurses. But while for Qt, integration testing is a solved problem, meaning there are multiple tools available, the situation is not that rose-colored in case of ncurses. On top, using different tooling would require additional efforts for the framework development. So everything started with openQA, which is using screen comparison with advanced fuzzy logic. This approach kept the costs of the tests development low, but maintenance is still painful when UI changes.</p>
<p>Considering all of the above, Ladislav Slezák and Rodion Iafarov has been working on a proper solution taking <a href="https://blog.ladslezak.cz/2017/03/01/hackweek-15-yast-cucumber/">Ladislav&#8217;s proposal for Hack Week 15</a> as starting point. The idea is plain simple: provide an HTTP/JSON API which allows interacting with LibYUI by reading and setting different UI properties. Consequently, if some button was moved, resized or got new shortcut key assigned, we do not need to adapt the test code anymore.</p>
<p>Obviously, this functionality is not required in a production system, so we have created separate packages for this purpose. Here you can find <a href="https://github.com/libyui/libyui-rest-api">GitHub repository</a> containing some documentation.</p>
<h3 id="demo-time">Demo time!</h3>
<p>As cool as it sounds, it is even better when you see it in action. In the screencast below you can see how the user can interact with YaST Host module using <em>cURL</em> from the command line. </p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/libyui-testing-framework-in-action.gif"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/libyui-testing-framework-in-action-300x274.gif" alt="LibYUI Testing Framework in Action" width="300" height="274" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13807" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/libyui-testing-framework-in-action-300x274.gif 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/libyui-testing-framework-in-action-768x701.gif 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3 id="how-to-test-the-new-packages">How to Test the New Packages</h3>
<p>If you want to give it a try, you can use the packages we have prepared for you. However, it is recommended to use a virtual machine to not pollute (or accidentally break) your system. You have been warned. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>First of all, you need to get new packages, which are currently available in <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/YaST:Head">YaST:Head project in OBS</a>. Navigate to <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:Head">Repositories tab</a> and get the repository which matches the distribution you are running. Afterwards you should be able to install <code>libyui-rest-api</code> package. Also, you need to update related packages and YaST2 modules were recompiled using latest LibYUI. To do that, simply run the following command, where <code>YaST:Head</code> is the repository added in the previous step:
</p>
<pre>
zypper up --allow-vendor-change -r YaST:Head
</pre>
<p>With the required software in place, you need to start a YaST module setting the environment variable <code>Y2TEST</code> to 1:</p>
<pre>
xdg-su -c 'Y2TEST=1 YUI_HTTP_PORT=9999 yast2 host' # for Qt
sudo Y2TEST=1 YUI_HTTP_PORT=9999 yast2 host # for ncurses
</pre>
<p>To allow remote connections you can add <code>YUI_HTTP_REMOTE=1</code>. For security reasons, only connections from <code>localhost</code> are allowed by default.</p>
<p>Now you should be able to see something like the screenshot below by navigating with your browser to <code>http://localhost:9999</code>.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/libyui-testing-framework-browser.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/libyui-testing-framework-browser-300x300.png" alt="LibYUI Testing Framework Browser" width="300" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13808" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/libyui-testing-framework-browser-300x300.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/libyui-testing-framework-browser-150x150.png 150w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/libyui-testing-framework-browser-768x765.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/libyui-testing-framework-browser.png 944w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3 id="further-steps">Further steps</h3>
<p>As you can see, we have not implemented a wrapper for the POST and GET requests to the HTTP server yet, although it will be the next step. We are trying to to find a solution which allows us running tests locally from the terminal, in CI using stable distribution versions, and finally in openQA for development builds.</p>
<p>Other things which are coming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split the package into separate ncurses and Qt parts (fewer dependencies, not possible to test a minimal system without X).</li>
<li>Improve the plugin loading.</li>
<li>Support for more widgets and attributes.</li>
<li>Add <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/tutorial.html#Supporting-basic-authentication">basic authentication</a> support.</li>
<li>Improve security <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/tutorial.html#Adding-a-layer-of-security">adding support for encryption and peer verification via SSL</a>.</li>
<li>Add support for the Gtk based UI.</li>
<li>Add IPv6 support (<a href="https://github.com/rboulton/libmicrohttpd/blob/master/src/examples/dual_stack_example.c">example</a>). After all, we are already in 2019. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security-notice">Security Notice</h3>
<p>YaST is usually running with the <code>root</code> permissions, that means everybody who can connect to the HTTP/JSON API can read the values and send button clicks. And because there is no authentication yet, this is a big security problem. In a nutshell: <b>do not use the API in production systems! It has been designed only for testing in a secure environment</b>.</p>
<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3>
<p>We are pretty excited about this project for several reasons. On the one hand, because we expect it to reduce the maintenance burden of our integration tests. On the other hand, because it is a nice example of Hack Week benefits and cross-team collaboration.</p>
<p>If you are interested, we will try to keep you in the loop by posting information regularly as part of YaST sprints reports.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here we go again with a new report from the YaST trenches. This time with the storage reimplementation as the clear star of the show.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: the proposal adapts, you succeed</h3>
<p>As we have announced in our previous sprints and as you probably already know, the YaST team is working hard to rewrite the whole storage stack on time for SLE15 and openSUSE Leap 15. As part of this reimplementation we have designed a brand new storage proposal that automagically offers the user the best combination of partitions and LVM volumes based on the current configuration of the system and the user preferences.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/proposal.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/proposal-300x225.png" alt="The storage proposal in action" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12592" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/proposal-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/proposal-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/proposal.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>When we are working with very small disks or with special technologies like DASD (which doesn&#8217;t accept more than three partitions by device), the storage proposal might not be able to generate a valid initial proposal honoring the initial requirements of the product (e.g. creating a separate home partition and enabling btrfs snapshots for the root partition in the openSUSE Leap case). Now the proposal is not limited to fail when it is not possible to satisfy the default product requirements. Before giving up, the new system looks for alternatives, like discarding the separate home partition or disabling snapshots. Moreover, now the proposal is able to automatically adjust the size requirements not only for root, but also for swap and home. And, of course, the guided setup continues there for fine tuning the proposal settings.</p>
<h3>Desktop selection improvements</h3>
<p>As our usual readers also know, we recently introduced a more fair desktop selection screen for openSUSE, both Leap 42.3 and Tumbleweed. We used part of the latest sprint to implement some feedback we gathered about the wording and behavior of that dialog.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/desktop-selection.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/desktop-selection-300x225.png" alt="Revamped desktop selection screen" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12593" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/desktop-selection-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/desktop-selection-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/desktop-selection.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>That feedback gathering included some discussions on how to make user experience nicer after selecting one of the user interfaces available through the &#8220;custom&#8221; option. As a result, the awesome openSUSE crew created a new mechanism for selecting the default window manager on each graphical login, so YaST can delegate the details to the maintainers of those alternative interfaces.</p>
<p>How everything works now? Glad you asked. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>If the user select KDE or GNOME in the YaST dialog, <code>/etc/sysconfig/windowmanager</code> is configured to point to that desktop by default. If the &#8220;custom&#8221; option is selected, then YaST does not enforce any interface in that file and the new mechanism comes into play. It relies in the <code>default.desktop</code> file, which defines the default window manager and can be managed by the common <code>update-alternatives</code> workflow. Meaning it can be easily tweaked by the package maintainers and by the users, specially since YaST includes a nice module for managing alternatives.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: improvements in the expert partitioner</h3>
<p>Although, as explained above, we keep improving the storage automatic proposal to support more and more situations, we cannot ignore that flexibility and adaptability have always been two of the flagships of (open)SUSE. And one of the most prominent examples is the YaST Expert Partitioner.</p>
<p>As detailed in <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/2017/06/16/yast-sprint-36/">our report of the sprint 36</a>, we have been rewriting that powerful Swiss Army knife using the new storage stack but keeping the same user interface and functionality. So far, the new implementation was only able to display information about the existing partitions, LVM systems and MD RAIDs. But now we added many options to create, edit and delete partitions.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/expert-partitioner-inst.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/expert-partitioner-inst-300x225.png" alt="Using the expert partitioner during installation" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12597" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/expert-partitioner-inst-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/expert-partitioner-inst-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/expert-partitioner-inst.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>It is still a work in progress because the number of possibilities offered by the YaST Partitioner is sometimes overwhelming and implementing them all takes time, but it&#8217;s progressing nicely.</p>
<p>Beside the improvements in the Partitioner itself, we also worked on its integration in the installation workflow. Now the Expert Partitioner can be used to refine the schema automatically proposed by the installer. As a bonus, the behavior of the &#8220;abort&#8221; and &#8220;finish&#8221; buttons has been improved in relation to the Expert Partitioner currently available in (open)SUSE, which historically shows a usability inconsistency there compared to the rest of the installation process.</p>

<h3>Fixed Automatic Patch Installation</h3>
<p>In both SLE and openSUSE Leap, the online updates can be installed either manually or automatically at some regular intervals. For the automatic installation we provide the <code>yast2-online-update-configuration</code> package which provides a cron job script and an YaST module for configuring it (hint: it is not installed by default, you might give it a try, maybe it is something &#8220;new&#8221; for you).</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/yast-online-update.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/yast-online-update-300x242.png" alt="Configuring online updates via YaST" width="300" height="242" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12595" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/yast-online-update-300x242.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/yast-online-update.png 623w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>You can configure how often the patches should be installed or filter the patch categories in the YaST module, but we got a bug report saying that when multiple patch categories are selected only one is actually used.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a trivial mistake in the cron job and we fixed it for SLE12-SP2 and Leap 42.2, as well as for the upcoming SLE12-SP3 and Leap 42.3. So if you use this module and want to use the category filter then it&#8217;s recommended to upgrade the package.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: many steps forward in the AutoYaST integration</h3>
<p>And going back to our new storage stack, we keep working to integrate it better with other parts of YaST, specially AutoYaST. During this sprint we polished some rough edges and we added support for MD RAID. With all that, now is possible to automatically setup a system based on an AutoYaST profile containing any combination of partitions, LVM systems and MD arrays, including encryption at any of the levels.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/autoyast-raid-lvm.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/autoyast-raid-lvm-300x216.png" alt="AutoYaST summary of actions on partitions, MD RAID and  LVM" width="300" height="216" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12602" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/autoyast-raid-lvm-300x216.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/autoyast-raid-lvm-768x552.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/autoyast-raid-lvm.png 1012w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>But the relation of AutoYaST with the system works in both directions. Apart from being able to install a system based on an AutoYaST profile, it also offers the interface to export the current system configuration, including the storage layout, to a profile in order to reproduce the system later. During this sprint we also ported that logic to rely on the new storage layer.</p>
<p>It was harder than it sounds, due to the need of keeping the backwards-compatibility with several behaviors that have been introduced along the AutoYaST history to adapt to several specific situations. On the bright side, the new code is easier to follow, includes behavior-driven automated tests (RSpec) and contains information about the rationale of each decision&#8230; which in some cases required some archaeology.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: fixed bootloader proposal in S/390 and PowerPC</h3>
<p>Another part of YaST we are constantly working to integrate better with the new storage stack is <code>yast2-bootloader</code>. Although the new storage system was already able to correctly setup a valid disk layout for most situations and architectures (each one with it&#8217;s own requirements for booting), our bootloader module is still not fully compatible with the new system in all those scenarios.</p>
<p>During this sprint, we adapted it to ensure all the combinations suggested by the new storage stack (partitions, LVM, encryption and so on) are correctly covered by YaST2-Bootloader. As a result, we can already say that our testing ISO images are fully installable in any x86_64, PowerPC and S/390 system by just clicking &#8220;next&#8221; a few times. And we have automated integration tests (a separate openQA instance) to ensure the resulting system boots just fine.</p>
<h3>UDEV device id on PowerPC</h3>
<p>We know some of our readers enjoy our more technical posts and like to lurk into the kitchen to see how we deal with all kind of surprises maintaining a complex tool like YaST. Today&#8217;s chapter in that regard started with a bug report about the bootloader being installed in the wrong device name (<code>/dev/vda</code> instead of <code>/dev/vdb</code>) in an emulated PowerPC machine in openQA.</p>
<p>After a lot of investigation and with help from our PowerPC expert, we found the culprit, that turned out to be an emulator quirk. The next couple of paragraphs may be interesting or daunting, depending how much virtualization and PowerPC jargon you know. Be warned.</p>
<p>On POWER, the PReP partition containing the bootloader has no unique identifier other than the serial number of the disk on which it created. QEMU virtualization does not provide any disk serial number when the user does not explicitly specify one. This means that the PReP partition in QEMU installation does not have any unique identification and the partition name may change when a disk is added or removed from the virtual machine or the storage configuration otherwise changes. This may lead to system errors related to bootloader installation and updates.</p>
<p>It is recommended to assign a unique serial number to each disk in a QEMU virtual machine on POWER when it is expected the storage configuration of the virtual machine may change. Otherwise, there is nothing YaST or any other tool running within the virtual machine can do to avoid the problems. So this time we only did the investigation part, with the fix coming from the openQA side, which was improved to explicitly set serial numbers when needed.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: better support for advanced scenarios</h3>
<p>As exposed above, our StorageNG testing image already works in all the supported architectures and in scenarios combining plain partitions, LVM, RAID and encryption in any way. But there are even more situations and technologies currently supported by YaST that we need to incorporate into the new stack.</p>
<p>First of all, we used this sprint to add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_I/O">Multipath I/O</a> support to the new libstorage. Now it can also be combined with all the other mentioned technologies (like having an LVM system on top of an encrypted multipath device), although the storage proposal still needs to be adapted to play nicely with preexisting multipath setups.</p>
<p>As usual with the library stuff, the best &#8220;screenshot&#8221; we have to offer is one of its geeky autogenerated graphs.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/multipath.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/multipath-300x140.png" alt="A multipath layout in libstorage-ng" width="300" height="140" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12605" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/multipath-300x140.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/multipath-768x358.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/multipath-1024x477.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/multipath.png 1323w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Another scenario that goes beyond the most regular use cases is installing the system into a network storage device, instead of a local hard disk. Now, the new storage system can report whether a root filesystem via a network is used. When that happens, YaST sets the network interfaces with the start mode <code>nfsroot</code>, which is used to avoid interface shutdown and, therefore, the unavailability of the system.</p>
<h3>That&#8217;s all, folks!</h3>
<p>Once again, we omitted the boring parts about bugfixing (with <code>yast2-ntp-client</code> being the star in that regard) and similar stuff. We hope you enjoyed the report and we hope to reach you again in two weeks. Meanwhile&#8230;</p>
<p>Have a lot of fun testing the Leap 42.3 pre-releases and reporting bugs!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During this Hack Week, some of our team members invested quite some time working in YaST related projects. But, what&#8217;s even better, some people from outside the team worked also in YaST projects. Thank you guys!</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s summarize those projects and also some extra ones from our team members.</p>
<h3>Let&#8217;s Encrypt made easy in openSUSE</h3>
<p>Daniel Molkentin enjoyed his first Hack Week working together with Klaas Freitag to bring <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a> integration to openSUSE. Although they didn&#8217;t had experience with YaST development, they followed the <a href="http://yast.github.io/yast-journalctl-tutorial/">YaST tutorial</a> and created a new brand yast-acme module. It&#8217;s still a work in progress, but it looks promising.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/yast-acme.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12337" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/yast-acme-300x146.png" alt="Managing certificates" width="300" height="146" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/yast-acme-300x146.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/yast-acme-768x372.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/yast-acme-1024x497.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/yast-acme.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>You can get more details reading the <a href="https://daniel.molkentin.net/2017/02/28/letsencrypt-support-for-opensuse/">Daniel Molkentin&#8217;s blog post</a> about the project.</p>
<h3>Removing perl-apparmor dependency</h3>
<p>Goldwyn Rodrigues worked to remove the dependency of yast-apparmor on (now obsolete) perl-apparmor. There&#8217;s quite some work to do, but he&#8217;s heading in the right direction.</p>
<p>Find out more about the project in the <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/projects/get-rid-of-perl-apparmor">Hack Week page</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/goldwynr/yast-apparmor">Goldwyn&#8217;s fork.</a></p>
<h3>gfxboot for grub2</h3>
<p>Steffen Winterfeldt was working in <em>gfxboot2</em>, an attempt to provide a graphical user interface for grub2. Although it&#8217;s still a work in progress, it looks really good: module works for <em>grub2-legacy</em> and <em>grub2-efi</em>, basic font rendering is in place, language primitives are partly implemented, the integrated debugger already works&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gfxboot2_debug.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12341" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gfxboot2_debug-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gfxboot2_debug-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gfxboot2_debug-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gfxboot2_debug.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>You can find further information in the <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/15/projects/gfxboot-for-grub2">projects page</a>.</p>
<h3>YaST Integration Tests using Cucumber</h3>
<p>The YaST team is always trying to improve their testing tools so Ladislav Slezák has been working in a proof of concept to use <a href="http://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a> to run YaST integration tests and the results are pretty impressive. The prototype is able to test YaST in an installed system, during installation and it can be used even for plain libyui applications outside YaST.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add_repo.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12344" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add_repo-300x298.gif" alt="Test adding repository" width="300" height="298" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add_repo-300x298.gif 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add_repo-150x150.gif 150w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/add_repo-768x763.gif 768w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>

<h3>Keep working on libstorage-ng</h3>
<p>If you follow YaST development, you know that the team is making good progress towards replacing the old <em>libstorage</em>. And even during Hack Week, <em>libstorage-ng</em> got some love from our hackers.</p>
<p>Arvin Schnell implemented support <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/15/projects/implement-more-all-missing-filesystems-in-libstorage-ng">for more filesystems in libstorage-ng</a>: ext2, ext3, ReiserFS, ISO 9660, UDF and basic support for NFS.</p>
<p>Iván López invested his first Hack Week improving <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/15/projects/yast-storage-ng-improvements">yast2-storage-ng</a>. Read this <a href="https://gist.github.com/joseivanlopez/4b1f1091d212b10b0970cdd691ea2f2e">description</a> to find out more information about the changes.</p>
<p>And last but not least, apart from helping Iván with his project, Ancor González worked in a <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/projects/yast2-storage-ng-as-a-libstorage-ng-wrapper-poc">new approach for <em>yast2-storage-ng</em></a>: instead of just extending the API offered by <em>libstorage-ng</em>, the idea is to wrap the library so the Ruby code using <em>yast2-storage-ng</em> does not have direct visibility on the <em>libstorage-ng</em> classes and methods.</p>
<h3>More Ruby in YaST</h3>
<p>Josef Reidinger is trying to reduce the amount of code in other languages different than Ruby. He successfully replaced the binary <em>y2base</em> with a Ruby version (not merged yet) and reduced the amount of Perl code in the <em>yast2</em> package.</p>
<p>You can check the progress in <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-ruby-bindings/pull/191">yast-ruby-bindings#191</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-yast2/pull/540">yast-yast2#540</a> pull requests.</p>
<h3>Support for Salt parametrizable formulas</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/imobachgs/yast-cm">YaST2 CM</a> was born in 2016 as a proof of concept to somehow integrate AutoYaST with Software Configuration Management systems like Salt or Puppet.</p>
<p>During this Hack Week, Duncan Mac Vicar and Imobach González were working to implement support for Salt parametrizable formulas. You can find out more information in this <a href="https://imobachgs.github.io/yast/2017/03/01/yast2-cm-gets-support-for-salt-parametrizable-formulas.html">post at Imobach&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>
<h3>Other non-YaST projects</h3>
<p>Hack Week allows us to work in any project we want, so there&#8217;re also some non-YaST related projects that we would like to mention.</p>
<h4>Improved QDirStat</h4>
<p>QDirStat is a Qt-based tool which offers directory statistics. His author, Stefan Hundhammer,implemented some new features (like a better behavior when hovering over a tree map or improved logging) and fixed some bugs. Find out more details in the <a href="https://github.com/shundhammer/qdirstat#current-development-status">project&#8217;s README</a> and the <a href="">version 1.3 release notes</a>.</p>
<p>He also wrote an <a href="https://github.com/shundhammer/qdirstat/blob/master/doc/QDirStat-for-Servers.md">article</a> about how to use the application in headless systems (no X server, no Xlibs).</p>
<p>Current version is already available at <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/qdirstat?search_term=qdirstat">software.opensuse.org</a> so you could consider giving it a try.</p>
<h4>Learning new things</h4>
<p>Hack Week is a great opportunity to play with new stuff. With that idea in mind, Martin Vidner learned about Android development and wrote detailed instructions for starting with that: <a href="http://mvidner.blogspot.cz/2017/02/getting-started-in-android-development.html">Getting Started in Android Development: Part 1: Building the First App</a>, <a href="http://mvidner.blogspot.cz/2017/02/publishing-the-first-app.html">Part 2: Publishing the First App</a> and <a href="http://mvidner.blogspot.cz/2017/03/reducing-android-bloat.html">Part 3: Reducing Bloat</a>.</p>
<p>Knut Anderssen decided to try also some mobile development and enjoyed playing around with the <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a>.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>And that&#8217;s all! After Hack Week, we&#8217;re back to SCRUM and we&#8217;re now working sprint 32. We&#8217;ll give you additional details in our next &#8220;Highlights of YaST development&#8221; report.</p>
<p>Stay tunned!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we announced in <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=12263">the previous report</a>, our 31th Scrum sprint was slightly shorter than the usual ones. But you would never say so looking to this blog post. We have a lot of things to talk you about!</p>
<h3>Teaching the installer self-update to be a better citizen</h3>
<p>As you may know, YaST includes a <a href="https://fate.suse.com/319716">nice feature</a> which allows the installer to update itself in order to solve bugs in the installation media. This mechanism has been included in SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SP2, although it&#8217;s not enabled by default (you need to pass an extra option <code>selfupdate=1</code> to make it work).</p>
<p>So after getting some feedback, we&#8217;re working toward fixing some usability problems. The first of them is that, in some situations, the self-update mechanism is too intrusive.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario: you&#8217;re installing a system behind a firewall which prevents the machine to connect to the outside network. As the SUSE Customer Center will be unreachable, YaST complains about not being able to get the list of repositories for the self-update. And, after that, you get another complain because the fallback repository is not accessible. Two error messages and 2 timeouts.</p>
<p>And the situation could be even worse if you don&#8217;t have access to a DNS server (add another error message).</p>
<p>So after some discussion we&#8217;ve decided to show such errors only if the user has specified SMT or a custom self-update repository (which is also possible). In any other case, the error is logged and the self-update is skipped completely.</p>
<p>You can find further information in our <a href="https://gist.github.com/imobachgs/cb03b6a87dd5e31c89a9463d30db4252">Self-Update Use Cases and Error Handling document</a>.</p>
<p>During upcoming sprints, we&#8217;ll keep working on making the self-update feature great!</p>
<h3>Configuring workers during CaaSP installation</h3>
<p>While CaaSP release approaches, our team is still working hard to satisfy the new requirements. Thankfully, YaST is a pretty flexible tool and it allows us to change a lot of things.</p>
<p>For CaaSP installation, YaST features a one-dialog installation screen. During this sprint, configuration of the <code>Worker</code> role has been implemented, including validation of the entered URL and writing the value to the installed system. You can check the animated screenshot for details.</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/worker.gif" alt="The CaaSP worker configuration" /></p>
<h3>New desktop selection screen in openSUSE installer</h3>
<p>The world of Linux desktop environments change relatively quick, with new options popping-up and some projects being abandoned. Thanks to the openSUSE&#8217;s community of packagers we have a lot of these new desktop environments available on the openSUSE distributions. But the status of those packages for openSUSE is also subject to changes: some desktop environments are poorly maintained while others have a strong and active group of packagers and maintainer behind.</p>
<p>The YaST Team does not have enough overview and time to watch all these desktop environment and evaluate which one is ready or not for being in the installer&#8217;s desktop selection screen. So the openSUSE Release Team decided to replace this dialog with something a bit more generic but still useful for newcomers.</p>
<p>They asked the YaST Team to come up with a new dialog featuring the two openSUSE main desktops (KDE Plasma and GNOME) and allowing the easy selection of other environments without reworking the dialog in the future. The goal of that new dialog was to replace the existing one you can see in the following screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop-300x226.png" alt="The old desktop selection screen" width="300" height="226" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12312" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop-300x226.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop-768x579.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_desktop.png 1023w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>We decided the new dialog should rely on patterns for several reasons. The main one is that the set of patterns is under the close control of the openSUSE community, which looks more closely than us to the desktop environments and their integration into the distribution. Moreover, each pattern specifies its own icon and description that can be somehow re-used by the installer.</p>
<p>We also took the opportunity to merge this almost empty and outdated dialog with the new one.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos-300x226.png" alt="The old additional repositories screen" width="300" height="226" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12313" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos-300x226.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos-768x578.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos-1024x770.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/old_repos.png 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Addons are no longer produced for openSUSE, so only the second checkbox made any sense nowadays. Moreover, the functionality of that second checkbox directly influence the available selection of patterns, so it made more sense to merge everything in a single screen that keeping an extra step in the installation just to accommodate a checkbox.</p>
<p>So we sent a proposal for the new dialog to the opensuse-factory mailing list and, after implementing many of the ideas discussed there (like better wording or using a button instead of a checkbox for the online repositories), this is the new dialog that replaces the two ones mentioned above.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop-300x225.png" alt="The new desktop selection dialog" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12315" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop-768x577.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_desktop.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>Selecting &#8220;custom&#8221; will take the users to the already existing patterns selection screen. Just in case you don&#8217;t remember how that screen looks like, you can check this image.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns-300x225.png" alt="The patterns selection screen" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12316" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns-1024x768.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/patterns.png 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>If these screenshots are not enough to make your mind about the change, you can check the following animation, in which KDE Plasma is initially chosen to be changed at a later point (going back in the workflow) to LXQt.</p>
<p><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/desktop_animation.gif" alt="Desktop selection animation" /></p>
<p>It will take some time before the changes hit the Tumbleweed installer, since they obviously have a non-trivial impact on the openQA tests, that will need some adaptation.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everybody that contributed to this new feature by providing feedback and suggestions through the mailing list. Once again, the openSUSE community has proved to be simply awesome!</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: improved handling of logical partitions</h3>
<p>Our reimplementation of the storage layer keeps getting improvements here and there. With the base x86 case working, we are now implementing the tricky parts, like the partitions renumbering that takes place when dealing with logical partitions in a MBR style partition table.</p>
<p>With GPT partition tables or with primary partitions in a MBR partition table, the partition gets a number (like sda1) when it&#8217;s created and keeps that number for its whole lifetime. But logical partition gets constantly renumbered when other partitions are created and destroyed. We need to know in advance what device name every partition will get in order to configure everything beforehand and only commit the changes to the disk when the user clicks in the &#8220;install&#8221; (during the installation process) or &#8220;commit&#8221; (if running the expert partitioner).</p>
<p>Now, libstorage-ng is able to simulate in memory the re-numbering process, so we can calculate all the settings related to partitioning (like the configuration of the bootloader) before really touching the disk.</p>
<h3>Making kdump work in CaaSP</h3>
<p>When you enable the Kernel Crash Dump (kdump), you probably expect that you will get a kind of core dump, like you do for regular processes. What you might not expect is an automatic reboot. That is a nice bonus. If you are tired of waiting for an <em>actual</em> kernel crash, you can test your kdump setup by triggering a crash yourself. Just run this as root:</p>
<pre>
echo c &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger</code>
</pre>
<p>The way kdump works is by allocating some extra memory at boot time and putting a second kernel+initrd there. When the main kernel realizes it is crashing, it transfers control (by kexec) to the other one, which has only one purpose, to dump the memory of the crashed kernel.</p>
<p>In the upcoming Containers as a Service Platform, kdump was not working because the root filesystem is read-only there and we were not able to create the kdump initrd. We <a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-kdump/pull/73">fixed it</a> by creating it just after the RPMs are installed, when the FS is still read-write.</p>
<h3>Fixes for Snapper in CaaSP</h3>
<p>Kdump was not the only component affected by the fact of having a read-only filesystem in CaaSP. Snapper was also running into problems when trying to execute the <code>rollback</code> and <code>cleanup</code> operations. Now the problems are fixed. While working on that we did enough interesting findings to deserve a separate blog entry. So you can expect a new entry in the <a href="http://snapper.io/news.html">Snapper.io blog</a> soon.</p>
<h3>Snapshot-related improvements in the expert partitioner</h3>
<p>While we work on the new storage system, we are still taking care and improving the current one that will continue to be shipped with SLE12-SP3, SUSE CaaSP and openSUSE Leap 42.3. During this sprint we introduced a couple of usability improvements in the expert partitioner related to Btrfs subvolumes.</p>
<p>First of all, we moved the &#8220;Enable Snapshots&#8221; checkbox that was pretty much hidden in the &#8220;Subvolume Handling&#8221; dialog to the place where it really belongs &#8211; below the selector of the file-system type.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-300x187.png" alt="New location for enabling snapshots" width="300" height="187" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12327" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-300x187.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-768x478.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-1024x637.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots.png 1350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>In addition, we added the warning you can see in the screenshot below for users enabling snapshots in a potentially problematic setup.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning-300x186.png" alt="Warning for snapshots in a small partition" width="300" height="186" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12328" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning-300x186.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning-768x477.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning-1024x635.png 1024w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/snapshots-size-warning.png 1352w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Bring back the beta warning on CaaSP</h3>
<p>And talking about warnings, we improved the CaaSP installation dialog to show the Alpha/Beta product warning at the beginning. After changing the CaaSP installation to use the all-in-one dialog <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=12263">described in our previous post</a>, this feature was lost as it is part of the initial EULA dialog. Now it is back and the users should now properly see the current product status.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning-300x225.png" alt="The CaaSP alpha/beta warning pop-up" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-12305" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning-300x225.png 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning-768x576.png 768w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/caasp_warning.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: encrypted LVM proposal</h3>
<p>Back to our storage layer reimplementation, the new system is now able to propose a setup with encrypted LVM. Since some sprints ago, we were already able to propose a partition-based and a LVM setup. That means the new proposal is now feature-pair with the old one, with the only exceptions of Btrfs sub-volumes (that shouldn&#8217;t be a big challenge) and s/390 storage (that is still not properly managed by the underlying libstorage-ng).</p>
<p>The bright part is that the new code is written with re-usability in mind, which means implementing an encrypted partition-based proposal (with no LVM) would be trivial. The new code is 100% covered by automatic unit tests and scores to the top in all the automatic quality checkers we have run (like Rubycritics, CodeClimate, and Rubocop).</p>
<p>So now we are prepared for whatever the future brings, having lost no single feature in the way.</p>
<h3>Storage reimplementation: prototype if the UI for the proposal settings</h3>
<p>The next challenge is to make the power of that new storage proposal available to the users through the user interface. In the <a href="https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=12263">previous post</a> we presented the document describing the general ideas we wanted to discuss with UX experts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s our pleasure to announce we met the experts and we very easily reached an agreement on how the user interaction should be. During this sprint we already implemented a prototype of the future proposal settings wizard that is, as usual, included in our <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/YaST:/storage-ng/images/iso/">testing ISO</a>.</p>
<p>Now that we have solid foundations, it&#8217;s very likely that the following sprint will result in the fully working wizard, with almost-final wording and design.</p>
<h3>Support for CaaSP added to the AutoYaST integration tests</h3>
<p>While fixing a problem with AutoYaST and CaaSP, we decided to extend our AutoYaST integration testing tool to support CaaSP. But, as a side effect, we also made some additional improvements that were long overdue (like improving the procedure to download ISOs, reducing timeouts, etc.).</p>
<p>Now, our internal Jenkins instance takes care of running AutoYaST integration tests for the development version of CaaSP (as it already does for SLE 12 SP2).</p>
<h3>Services manager moved to first auto-installation stage</h3>
<p>AutoYaST allows to <a href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-12/singlehtml/book_autoyast/book_autoyast.html#CreateProfile.Services">define a set of services</a> to be enabled/disabled in the installed system, applying this configuration during the 2nd stage (after the first reboot).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this approach won&#8217;t work for CaaSP because, in that case, the 2nd stage won&#8217;t be available. For that reason, during this sprint, we have adapted AutoYaST to write services configuration during 1st stage.</p>
<p>As usual, not only CaaSP, but other future (open)SUSE versions will benefit of this change.</p>
<h3>Faster YaST installation when the release notes cannot be downloaded</h3>
<p>Sometimes a very small simple change in a program makes a very noticeable impact in its everyday use. That&#8217;s the case of a fix implemented during this sprint. YaST usually re-tries to download the distribution release notes several times if the first attempt was unsuccessful. Although that&#8217;s correct from a general point of view, there are cases in which retrying makes no sense and only delays the installation. We have now added failed DNS resolution to that list of cases, which should result in a noticeable faster installation in many scenarios.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the case of AutoYaST we now skip downloading the release notes completely. Downloading them don&#8217;t make us much sense in the kind of unattended scenarios handled by AutoYaST and skipping this step and all the possible associated problems result in a more robust process.</p>
<h3>Better continuous integration for Libyui</h3>
<p>In the previous sprint we switched to Docker at Travis so we could build and test our packages in the native openSUSE system instead of the default Ubuntu. This sprint we did the same change also for the Libyui library which implements the UI part of YaST.</p>
<p>Originally we could not build the Libyui packages at Travis as either the required build dependencies were missing or were present at a very old unusable version. With this switch we can easily use the latest packages from openSUSE Tumbleweed and thus enable Travis builds for all Libyui packages.</p>
<h3>See you after Hack Week!</h3>
<p>As already mentioned, this week is <a href="https://hackweek.suse.com/">Hack Week 15</a>! So our Scrum process will be on hold for some days. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the YaST development will stall. Since there are quite some YaST-related projects in the Hack Week page, you can expect YaST to simply go in unexpected directions. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>And remember Hack Week is not a SUSE internal initiative, we are open to collaboration from anybody within or outside the company. So jump in and have fun with us!</p>

<p>On November 16th there was the release of <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2016/11/16/optimal-release-for-linux-professionals-arrives-with-opensuse-leap-42-2/" target="1">openSUSE Leap 42.2</a>. On November 24th, I had the opportunity to present openSUSE Project at school.</p>
<p>I was asked to make an introduction to FLOSS in general and more specific about openSUSE Project. The school was for middle aged people, for persons who quited school to work and conftibute financially to their families. There were 3 classes that they taught something computer related. It was a great opportunity for them to learn what FLOSS is and what makes openSUSE great Linux distro.<br />
<span id="more-12138"></span><br />
I busted the myth that &#8220;Linux is hard because you have to be a hacker, it&#8217;s terminal operated&#8221; I showed them how to install openSUSE Leap step by step (pictures) and also how to use GNOME (pictures). I mentioned our tools to make a very stable distro and finally I showed them that it&#8217;s not only a distro but there are people (the communtity) that take care of the software.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a8n4panlnvm1fkl/presentation.jpg?raw=1" target="1"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a8n4panlnvm1fkl/presentation.jpg?raw=1" width="70%" height="70%"></a></p>
<p>There were plenty of questions about linux software alternatives, how to install, if they can replace Ubuntu/Windows with openSUSE and what is perfect suit for specific systems. Each student took a DVD with stikers and a card with Greek community information. Professors will organize an install fest for their lab and/or laptops of their students.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Douglas DeMaio for managing to send me DVDs and stickers and Alexandros Mouhtsis that managed with his professors to organize this presentation. Finally, I would like to thank <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/146573897@N06" target="1">Dimitrios Katsikas</a> for taking pictures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Warnings</h3>
<p>There’s no warranties the drivers will work, for you!</p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the open-source radeon drivers,<span style="color: #ff0000"> <b>don’t risk to break your computer !<br />
</b></span></p>
<p>Still there will NEVER be a fglrx driver for recent kernel and xorg. So if one of those component change in Leap fglrx will be broken.</p>
<h3>Actual situation</h3>
<p>Since last december, AMD doesn&#8217;t published any update about fglrx so the version is still the 15.12.302 published. A few days ago our beloved Leap release manager Ludwig ask me by email, if there will be an available drivers for Leap 42.2.</p>
<p>Today, after hacking a bit the last Sebastian Siebert&#8217;s script I&#8217;ve been able to build the drivers for Leap 42.2 RC1, and the driver install fine, and xorg start on my HD5750 (but that&#8217;s all what I can tell).</p>
<p>I will rebuild the driver once Leap 42.2 will hit its final stage.</p>
<h3>Repository</h3>
<pre>zypper ar -cfg -n FGLRX http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx/openSUSE_Leap_42.2/ FLGRX

zypper -v refresh -f FGLRX

zypper -v install fglrx64_amdcccle_SUSE422 fglrx64_core_SUSE422 fglrx64_graphics_SUSE422  fglrx64_opencl_SUSE422 fglrx64_xpic_SUSE422</pre>
<h3>Future</h3>
<p>AMD has stopped any development for FGLRX, so it is already considered obsolete. But on the other side they make a lot of effort to bring radeon and amdgpu (the free and open source driver) to a decent performance level.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have that much usage anymore of my AMD gpu powered computer, and my HD5750 is now 8 years old already, so I can&#8217;t promise to be able to follow up with changes.</p>
<h3>Cleanup</h3>
<p>I removed all the obsoletes packages letting only the last one for each openSUSE version still available. Also the server has no more copy of openSUSE github artwork. If this missing to someone, don&#8217;t hesitate to ask.</p>
<p>Have fun</p>

This effectively makes it the only enterprise grade long term supported(LTS) distribution for Education.</p>
<p>As with previous releases <a href="http://download.opensuse-education.org/~cyberorg/opensuse-edu-life-4211-packages.txt">we have bundled a ton of softwares</a> on this <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Live_USB_stick">live DVD/USB</a> specially packaged for education, along with the Plasma, GNOME and Mate Desktop Environments, full multimedia experience is also provided out of the box thanks to the Packman repositories. Only x86_64 architecture is supported, if you have a lot of machines that only support x86 then read on to find out how you can extend their Li-f-e.<br />
<span id="more-11596"></span></p>
<p>You can of course very <a href="http://cyberorg.github.io/kiwi-ltsp-howto/">easily turn Li-f-e to full-fledged LTSP server</a> to PXE boot machines in your local network. Booting both i686 and x86_64 architectures is supported. In case you need to PXE boot machines below i686 then you would have to <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/package/kiwi-ltsp-tinycore-tc">install this package</a>.</p>

<h1 style="color:red">Tumbleweed beware : broken Xorg</h1>
<p>It seems since the release, that a number of report of broken xorg with gdm, ssdm and so&#8230; segfaulting</p>
<p>You can still use the previous version hanging on the server. But I doubt it would work better</p>
<p>As soon, with Sebastian Siebert we have a patch for, I will republish a new build</p>

<h4>Sebastien Siebert making script</h4>

<p>If you have any problems with the driver, don&#8217;t be afraid to report to Sebastian (German and English bugreports are gladly accepted).<br />
he will try, as far as I am able to reproduce the bug. Together with the necessary system information, he will go directly to the right place at AMD to have the bug fixed in the next driver release.<br />
Thank you very much, Sebastian.
</p>
<p>See below what to do in case of troubles.</p>
<p>Or you can also ping him on irc (freespacer)</p>
<h4>Debugging troubles</h4>
<p>I recommend in case of trouble the use of <a href="http://www.sebastian-siebert.de/downloads/makerpm-amd-15.11.sh">his script</a> which can collect the whole informations needed to help you. then you just have to issue a simple commande in console to collect all informations, you can review them, and finally transmit them.<br />

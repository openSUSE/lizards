          <div class="entry">
            <p>Hello people and welcome to this week&#8217;s Kernel News, served OpenSUSE style!</p>
<p>-Let us start with the release of 2.6.34 and its&#8217; impact in the digital press : Slashdot has an article announcing this here : http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/-VgxbnDvjiA/Linux-2634-Released,  The H Online has a short(er) version of the &#8220;What&#8217;s new in 2.6.34&#8243; series here: http://www.h-online.com/open/features/What-s-new-in-Linux-2-6-34-1000122.html and of course a separate article with the announcement itself.</p>
<p>-Also, Phoronix has an article titled &#8220;Linux 2.6.34 Kernel Released! Time For 2.6.35&#8243;, written by Michael Larabel, where he highlights briefly what&#8217;s new in .34 as well as what&#8217;s to come in .35, from the available info about that.<br />
-OSNews also writes about the release of 2.6.34; read all of that here: http://osnews.com/story/23312/Linux_2_6_34_Released</p>
<p>-Mathieu Desnoyers announced the release of the LTTNG tree for 2.6.33.4, version 0.214.</p>
<p>-The notify tree got updates, as announced by Eric Paris, for -rcX, in the following  summary : &#8220;This branch holds a couple of bug fixes (two of which are actually stable material).  A pathological race which would put us in a use after free / double free situation when one thread attempts to delete an inotify watch while another thread is still adding that watch.  A memory leak and a Kconfig issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>-H. Peter Anvin posted five fixes for 2.6.34{,-rc8} in regard of the x86 tree.</p>
<p>-As usual, Steven Rostedt posted tracing fixes consisting of patches and a typo fix.</p>
<p>-Ingo Molnar and Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo both had perf or perf-tools-related fixes, Al Viro posted vfs fixes for .34, David Miller came up with networking fixes and improvements, Frederic Weisbecker tells about his tracing fixes for 2.6.35-rc1, again Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo posted some more perf fixes, Geert Uytterhoeven announced updates for the 2.6.35 in m68k (Motorola CPUs), Ingo also had fixes for the core- debugobjects tree (2.6.35) and the same Ingo posted patches for the core-iommu tree, again for 2.6.35.</p>
<p>-And of course, ladies and gents, how could we miss the official announcement of the man himself? Here&#8217;s Linus&#8217; announcement regarding the release of 2.6.34: &#8220;Nothing very interesting here, which is just how I like it. Various random fixes all over, nothing really stands out. Pretty much all of it is one- or few-liners, I think the biggest patch in the last week was fixing some semantics for the new SR-IOV VF netlink interface. And even that wasn&#8217;t  a _big_ patch by any means.</p>
<p>So 2.6.34 is out, and the merge window is thus officially open. As usual, I probably won&#8217;t do any real pulls for a day or two, in the (probably futile) hope that we&#8217;ll have more people running plain 2.6.34 for a while. But you can certainly start sending me pull requests. Go forth and test, Linus&#8221;</p>
<p>-Seems like Ingo Molnar&#8217;s been a busy bee this week as he posted, besides the fixes/patches already mentioned, other fixes for trees including locking, RCU, sched, tracing, atomic, cleanups, asm, doc, fpu, irq, hweight and oprofile; also for mm, mrst, txt, pat and uv. All these fixes are for the x86 architecture regarding 2.6.35.</p>
<p>-Jonathan Corbet of LWN fame posted some viafb and documentation patches, while Roland Dreier of Cisco posted a first batch of fixes for the Infiniband tree; Martin Schwidefsky had some patches for the s390 tree (for the 2.6.35 merge window) and Steven Whitehouse posted few patches for the GFS2 tree.</p>
<p>-Mauro Carvalho Chehab posted the minutes of the Hardware Error Kernel Mini-Summit, which was held  April the 15th (http://events.linuxfoundation.org/lfcs2010/edac), so that other kernel hackers can<br />
benefit from it.</p>
<p>-The nfs tree benefited from fixes aimed at 2.6.35, thanks to Trond Myklebust, and so did the sh tree, with the patches submitted by Paul Mundt &#8211; his fixes were aimed at 2.6.35-rc1.</p>
<p>-In another round of fixes, we see James Bottomley with SCSI fixes for 2.6.35, Thomas Gleixner with genirq, hpet and timer fixes/cleanups for .35 also, Tejun Heo also came up with fixes for percpu and workqueue (2.6.35-rc1), Daniel Walker has some fixes and a pull request regarding MSM mmc_sdcc driver updates, Rafael J. Wisocki with pm updates (suspend tree) for .35 and Mauro Carvalho Chehab posted improvements regarding the i7 processors, namely &#8220;for memory error detection for the Memory Controllers found on the Nehalem CPU&#8217;s, from i7core to Xeon 56xx,<br />
via EDAC interface.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Samuel Thibault announced the release of hwloc 1.0 : &#8220;hwloc provides command line tools and a C API to obtain the hierarchical map of key computing elements, such as: NUMA memory nodes, shared caches, processor sockets, processor cores, and processor &#8220;threads&#8221;.  hwloc also gathers various attributes such as cache and memory information, and is portable across a variety of different operating systems and platforms.</p>
<p>The hwloc team considers version 1.0 to be the first production-quality release that is suitable for widespread adoption.  Please send your feedback on hwloc experiences to our mailing lists (see the web site, above).&#8221;</p>
<p>-Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo came up again with perf fixes , Jason Wessel with some improvements in kdb for .35, Dave Airlie posted fixes for drm meant for -rc1, Dominic Brodowski with PCMCIA (for 2.6.35), Rusty Russell &#8211; modules, and, in the other fixes category, we have Avi Kivity with KVM fixes, Frederic Weisbecker having fixes for the random-tracing tree, Rusty Russell again with virtio<br />
patches, Jiri Kosina of OpenSUSE with HID and trivial (trivial is actually a tree <img src='//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> ) and Ian Campbell with a Xen suspend/resume fix.</p>
<p>-Stephen Hemminger announced the appearance of an new version for iproute2 for 2.6.34, stating  &#8220;This version of iproute2 utilities intended for use with 2.6.34 or<br />
later kernel, but should be backward compatible with older releases. In addition to build and man page fixes, this release includes a support for several new features:</p>
<p>* SR-IOV (I/O Virtualization) support.<br />
* tuntap support<br />
* bus-error reporting and counters<br />
* new FIFO type head drop queue discipline&#8221;</p>
<p>-Jeff Garzik announced quite a few libata updates and fixes for 2.6.35, while Kevin Hilman asked Linus to pull some RTC fixes for the davinci tree, targettin .35; in other non-x86 arch fixes and news, David Miller posted some sparc fixes and an ARM MSM update from Daniel Walker, also targetting 2.6.35.</p>
<p>-XFS updates targetting -rc1 were posted by Alex Elder, the async_tx tree got updated by Dan Williams while David Miller announced significant improvements for the networking tree with the following (lengthy) message : &#8220;The biggest two things in here are RPS  (Receive Packet Steering) and RFS (Receive Flow Steering) support from Tom Herbert et al.at Google.</p>
<p>RPS allows one to specify a cpu mask per device RX queue, and we will steer RX packet work, in software, to those cpus.  RPS essentially provides in software what many modern cards can do in hardware with the added flexibility of being able to constrain CPU targets arbitrarily.  RPS is also, therefore, not in conflict with cards that can flow distribute to cpus completely in hardware.</p>
<p>RFS tries to be even more sophisticated than RPS.  It watches on which cpu a socket makes I/O calls, and will steer future RX packets to that cpu.  In this way RX packet work is done near to where the application will actually process the data.</p>
<p>In both the case of RPS and RFS, if the device provides a flow hash (just about every modern card does), we make use of it instead of computing it in software. RPS/RFS has been found to even help for things like tbench over loopback.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Nicholas A. Bellinger announced &#8220;that the v3.4.0 stable release of TCM/LIO has been tagged and branched into lio-core-2.6.git/lio-3.4.  This release is now tracking upstream linux-2.6.34.y.git for future stable kernel releases.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Speaking of announcements, Mathieu Desnoyers announced ltt-control v 0.85 with the following words : &#8220;I just released ltt-control 0.85 which waits for previous subbuffers to be written to disk(using sync_file_range()) and uses fadvise to tell the kernel that pages won&#8217;t be reaccessed. This lessens the tracer impact on the page cache.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Len Brown posted fixes in the acpica tree for 2.6.35, Mauro Carvalho Chehab has new patches for V4L/DVB, Paul Mundt has a number of patches for the Genesis machines (-rc1) and Takashi Iwai updated the sound tree with some patches for -rc1.</p>
<p>-Con Kolivas announced 2.6.34-ck1 with a quite short announcement, followed by the list of patches. Con also made the following announcement : &#8220;This is to briefly announce the availability of the desktop interactivity focused BFS CPU scheduler v0.318 for the new stable linux 2.6.34 kernel.This version is also available for 2.6.32 and 2.6.31.&#8221;</p>
<p>-Artem Bityutskiy posted git pull requests related to ubi and ubifs for 2.6.35, while Matthew Garett has some x86 driver changes also for 2.6.35. Dmirty Torokhov pushed updates for the input tree affecting -rc0 and David Teigland fixed some lockups and posted cleanups for the dlm tree; in other push news, Frederic Weisbecker made another series of perf fixes pertaining to perf_event.c, namely a fix in preempt_enable(), Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo also has fixes for the perf tree, USB patches for .35 came from OpenSUSE&#8217;s Greg Kroah-Hartman, the ocfs2 tree got updated by Joel Becker (2.6.35 as target) and Sascha Hauer posted some changes related to Arm i.MX.</p>
<p>-Andrea Arcangeli posted a very interesting idea regarding the use of transparent huge pages on load-critical systems, like the ones running scientific applications, JVM or gcc builds; since the annoucement is too big, I won&#8217;t post it here, but if you&#8217;re interested, you may wanna check the list archives.</p>
<p>-In closing this week&#8217;s edition, some noticeable changes/fixes are : OMAP DSS updates for .35 (Tomi Valkeinen) and powerpc fixes by Benjamin Herrenschmidt.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it, see you next week!</p>

            <p>I’m happy to announce OpenOffice.org <em>3.2.1 rc1</em>packages for<em> openSUSE</em>. They are available in the Build Service <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Additional_YaST_Package_Repositories#OpenOffice.org_UNSTABLE">OpenOffice:org:UNSTABLE</a> project, are based on the <a href="http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.2.1rc1.html" target="_blank">upstream</a> <em>3.2.1-rc1</em> sources and include many <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/ooo-build/ooo-build/plain/NEWS?id=OOO_BUILD_3_2_1_1" target="_blank">Go-oo</a> fixes and improvements. Please, look for more details about the <em>openSUSE OOo build</em> on the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/OpenOffice.org" target="_blank">wiki page</a>.</p>
<p>The packages are release candidates and have not passed full QA cycle yet. They might include even serious bugs. Therefore they are <em>not</em> intended for <em>data-critical</em> usage. A good practice is to archive any important data before an use, …</p>
<p>As usual, we kindly ask any interested <em>beta testers</em> to try the package and <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/OpenOffice.org#Reporting_Bugs" target="_blank">report bugs</a>. See also the list of <a href="http://alturl.com/qaq5">known bugs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Other information and plans:</strong></p>
<p>The package does not build in Factory because of the bug <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=604251">bnc#604251</a>.  I hope that it will get fixed soon.</p>
<p>The bug <a href="http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=111636">i#111636</a> has been considered as a blocker, so you might expect <em>rc2</em> the following week.</p>

            <p>It has been far too long since the GNOME Team actually put their heads together and talked about what is going on in the garden.  As such regular meetings are re-starting, but with a slight difference &#8211; it will be monthly on the 3rd Tuesday of each month at 1400UTC, for localised times please see <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?day=18&amp;month=5&amp;year=2010&amp;hour=14&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=0">here</a>.</p>
<p>That means the next meeting will be held this Tuesday, 18th May 2010, in the garden (otherwise known as <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/opensuse-gnome">#opensuse-gnome</a> on Freenode).  The Agenda is pretty simple and can be added to on the <a href="http://http://en.opensuse.org/GNOME/Meetings/20100518">wiki</a>.  For those curious it will kind of follow the lines of:</p>
<p>1. openSUSE GNOME Status<br />
  1.1 Packaging<br />
  1.2 Bugs<br />
  1.3 Q &amp; A<br />
2. Upstream GNOME Status<br />
  2.1 What&#8217;s New<br />
  2.2 Bugs<br />
  2.3 Q &amp; A<br />
3. General Q &amp; A</p>
<p>So please come buy the garden, pull up a chair and crack a cold one open.  Join in the fun and add anything you need to the agenda.</p>

            <p>Guest Blog</p>
<p>Greetings, and welcome!</p>
<p>-Starting this week&#8217;s news, The H Online have , since the 24th of March,  a series of articles titled &#8220;What&#8217;s new in 2.6.34&#8243;. You can find it here: http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Linux-Kernel-2-6-34-tracking-962586.html</p>
<p>-Frederic Weisbecker posted perf fixes for 2.6.34, James Bottomley came up with SCSI fixes for -rc6, Paul E. McKenney had some RCU fixes for 2.6.35; perf fixes came also from Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo.</p>
<p>-Christoph Hellwig posted a XFS status update for April 2010; we will paste his report here in its&#8217; entirety to let you get a clear picture : &#8220;In April 2.6.34 still was in the release candidate phase, with a hand full of XFS fixes making it into mainline.  Development for the 2.6.35 merge window went ahead full steam at the same time.</p>
<p>While a fair amount of patches hit the development tree these were largely cleanups, with the real development activity happening on the mailing list.  There was another round of patches and following discussion on the scalable busy extent tracking and delayed logging features mentioned last month.  They are expected to be merged in May and queue up for the Linux 2.6.35 window.  Last but not least April saw a large number of XFS fixes backported to the 2.6.32 and 2.6.33 -stable series.</p>
<p>In user land xfsprogs has seen few but important updates, preparing for a new release next month.  The xfs_repair tool saw a fix to correctly enable the lazy superblock counters on an existing filesystem, and xfs_fsr saw updates to better deal with dynamic attribute forks.  Last but not a least a port to Debian GNU/kFreeBSD9 got merged. The xfstests test suite saw two new test cases and various smaller fixes.&#8221;</p>
<p>-As usual, Rafael J. Wisocki announced the series of reported regressions from 2.6.33 (referring to 2.6.34-rc6-git6).</p>
<p>-No doubt, the most important news of this week is Linus&#8217; announcement of 2.6.34-rc7 : &#8220;I think this is the last -rc &#8211; things have been pretty quiet on the patch front, although there&#8217;s been some rather spirited discussions.Random fixes all around, some of them RCU related (people fixing various RCU sanity check warnings), but most of them just random driver fixes. And there&#8217;s some MIPS, microblaze and ARM updates, and ocfs2 and ceph fixes. The shortlog is about as informative as anything else &#8211; nothing there  stands out in my mind, it&#8217;s just a lot of small random stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>-OpenSUSE&#8217;s Jiri Kosina posted HID fixes, while H. Peter Anvin posted a RFC regarding virtualization &#8211; the hypervisor layer pertaining Hyper-V and VMware code cleanups.</p>
<p>-Robert Richter came up with oprofile hotplug fixes for x86, sound fixes came from Takashi Iwai, perf from Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo, wireless by John W. Linville, drm fixes by Dave Airlie and networking fixes by David Miller.</p>
<p>-The H Online features another interesting kernel log; you can read it, along with its interesting links, here http://www.h-online.com/open/features/Kernel-Log-New-stable-kernels-and-drivers-995820.html .</p>
<p>-Paul McKenney posted fixes for the RCU tree (for 2.6.35, rebased for -rc7), hwmon fixes appeared courtesy of Jean Delvare, some new perf fixes by Ingo Molnar and later by Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo, tracing by Steven Rostedt, AMD iommu by Joerg Roedel, patches for the s390 series for -rc7 by Martin Schwidefsky and some perf_event fixes for powerpc by Benjamin Herrenschmidt.</p>
<p>-Greg Kroah-Hartman posted the &#8220;start of the stable review cycle for the 2.6.32.13 release&#8221;, stating that &#8220;There are 98 patches in this series, all will be posted as a response to this one. If anyone has any issues with these being applied, please let us know.  If anyone is a maintainer of the proper subsystem, and wants to add a Signed-off-by: line to the patch, please respond with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>-The same Greg started the review process for 2.6.33.4, with the same message to anyone involved/interested.</p>
<p>-Pierre Tardy informed the community about PyTimechart by posting a RFC :  &#8220;PyTimechart is another implementation of two very useful tools available for the linux community: perf-timechart ( http://blog.fenrus.org/?p=5 ) and bootchart (http://www.bootchart.org/ ) The two tools share a common idea of making their output to SVG files. While it is a very good idea for small traces, the generated SVG can be very heavy, and turns out to be good stress tests for inkscape developers&#8230;<br />
PyTimechart is a tool that parses ftrace text traces, and display them with the help of a very powerful dynamic plot framework, Chaco (http://code.enthought.com/chaco/ ) The GUI makes the best it can to ease the browsing of huge traces.&#8221;<br />
All in all, the respondents to this mail seemed to welcome the application as being useful.</p>
<p>-In the latest fixes/patches/pull requests section, we have Paul E McKenny with an RCU lockdep splat fix, Sage Weil with ceph fixes for 2.6.34-final, Frederic Weisbecker has perf/nmi fixes (uniform lockup detector), Takashi Iwai with some sound fixes; Samuel Ortiz has some MFD fixes and Steve French came up with some minor cifs fixes.</p>
<p>-Greg Kroah-Hartman of OpenSUSE made the announcement of the release of kernels 2.6.32.13 and 2.6.33.4 .</p>
<p>-Marcello Tosatti announced a series of fixes for the kvm targetting 2.6.34-rc7, Greg Kroah-Hartman posted patches for the -git kernel regarding TTY, Steven Rostedt had some tracing updates, perf fixes by Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo were posted too, and Dmitry Korokhov has fixes for the input tree.</p>
<p>-Mathieu Desnoyers announced the release of LTTng 0.213, with various bugfixes and improvements.</p>
<p>-As usual, at least lately, Michal Simek has some patches/fixes for arch/microblaze, this time for -rc8.</p>
<p>-Michael S. Tsirkin posted &#8220;a last minute vhost-net fix&#8221; which fixes barrier pairing.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s it for this week&#8217;s OpenSUSE-flavoured kernel news!<br />
I&#8217;m off, enjoy the weekend!</p>

            <p>We all know we are doing well, we see that from your feedbacks, bugreports, obs submitreqs, and IRC. So guys.. Thank you a lot for supporting and helping us.</p>
<p>But do you think there is something better to see your work on a magazine? a national magazine? I guess it&#8217;s really exciting isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Well we did it! The Italian Linux Magazine wrote two entire pages for us, and our live cd (together with XFCE one) was into the attached DVD or CD!</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Have you ever thought how users should configure their systems, deployed by AutoYaST or kiwi? One of possible answers is called YaST Firstboot.</p>
<p>The YaST firstboot utility is a special kind of configuration workflow that can be run after the basic system is installed. It is started on the first boot of the system and guides a user through a series of steps that allow for easier configuration of their desktops. YaST firstboot does not run by default and has to be configured to run by the user or the system administrator. It is useful for image deployments where the system in the image is already configured (read: <a title="AutoYaST" href="http://en.opensuse.org/AutoYaST">AutoYaST</a>, <a title="SUSE Studio" href="http://en.opensuse.org/SUSE_Studio">SUSE_Studio</a>, <a title="KIWI" href="http://en.opensuse.org/KIWI">KIWI</a>), and end-user should do only the last few steps, like setting the root password.</p>
<h2>Enabling Firstboot</h2>
<p>To enable running firstboot configuration sequence on the machine, it is necessary to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Have yast2-firstboot package installed. Depending on your installation method, this means adding the package to the list of packages to be installed (e.g. for AutoYaST) or that are part of installation image.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Create the empty file /var/lib/YaST2/reconfig_system. If this file is present on system boot, firstboot configuration sequence is started. YaST Firstboot removes the file when the configuration is done.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Customizing YaST Firstboot</h2>
<p>There are two files that control the behavior of Firstboot: the firstboot control file (firstboot.xml) and the sysconfig file /etc/sysconfig/firstboot. The control file defines the steps that should be part of your configuration sequence, in the sysconfig file it is possible to define custom messages and paths to various files.</p>
<h3>Customized  Messages</h3>
<p>Most important texts configurable in sysconfig file is the text shown in the License Agreement screens. For license texts, there are sysconfig variables FIRSTBOOT_LICENSE_DIR and FIRSTBOOT_NOVELL_LICENSE_DIR.</p>
<p>The license text is read from the file &#8216;license.txt&#8217; or from &#8216;license_&lt;locale&gt;.txt&#8217;. The license texts of the Novell base product are by default installed to the directory /etc/YaST2/licenses/base/ &#8212; you can set different value to FIRSTBOOT_NOVELL_LICENSE_DIR if they are elsewhere. Use FIRSTBOOT_LICENSE_DIR to indicate a path to directory containing vendor licence texts; it is preferred to put these license texts into another subdirectory of /etc/YaST2/licenses/.</p>
<p>To show two license texts in one dialog (typically the one from vendor and one from Novell), use &#8216;firstboot_license_novell&#8217; step in your firstboot.xml file. This client will use the license texts specified by both FIRSTBOOT_LICENSE_DIR and FIRSTBOOT_NOVELL_LICENSE_DIR.</p>
<h3>Customized Workflow</h3>
<p>The default firstboot workflow can be controled using one single file which uses the same syntax as the control.xml file used to control the complete installation. The firstboot control file consists of workflow and proposal configurations and can be used to add or remove configuration screens depending on the end configuration of the system. The file firstboot.xml is installed with the yast2-firstboot package and can be found at the following location: /etc/YaST2/firstboot.xml.</p>
<p>This file can be modified to match the post installation requirements of the product in question. In addition to the default and pre-installed components, custom screens can be added to enable maximal flexiblity during post installation. Look into the example firstboot.xml file coming with your yast2-firstboot package for more available steps.</p>
<h2>Custom Scripts</h2>
<p>Not everything can be achieved with already prepared steps, and it is usually not necessary to write your own ycp dialogs.</p>
<p>You can add schell scripts to be executed at the end of the firstboot configuration. Scripts should be placed in /usr/share/firstboot/scripts or in a custom location that can be set using the variable SCRIPT_DIR of /etc/sysconfig/firstboot configuration file. The scripts are executed in alphabetical order of their names.</p>
<h2>AutoYaST Support</h2>
<p>It is possible to configure the firstboot process as a part of autoinstallation, so the system can be installed with most of the default values set via <a title="AutoYaST" href="http://en.opensuse.org/AutoYaST">AutoYaST</a> profile, leaving the rest to the end user during the firstboot sequence.</p>
<p>As a part of autoinstallation configuration, you need to provide all the changes mentioned above:</p>
<ul>
<li> Customize /etc/sysconfig/firstboot: it can be done e.g. via Sysconfig Editor in System section of AutoYaST configuration module.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Provide customized firstboot.xml file and point to its location in FIRSTBOOT_CONTROL_FILE value of /etc/sysconfig/firstboot.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Enable Firstboot: do it via GUI in Misc/Firstboot section of AutoYaST configuration module or manually by adding the section</li>
</ul>
<pre>&lt;firstboot&gt;
   &lt;firstboot_enabled config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/firstboot_enabled&gt;
&lt;/firstboot&gt;</pre>
<p>to your AutoYaST profile.</p>

            <p>During the last week blogs, twitter, facebook and other means of communication for the users experienced a lot of traffic related to the <a href="http://www.wolfire.com/humble">Humble Indie Bundle</a>. This bundle was nothing more than a package composed of 6 DRM-Free games developed by 6 Independent game developers that could be obtained at a price set by the user. This bundle included the games <a href="http://2dboy.com/games.php">World of Goo</a>, <a href="http://www.bit-blot.com/aquaria/">Aquaria</a>, <a href="http://www.crypticsea.com/gish/">Gish</a>, <a href="http://www.wolfire.com/lugaru">Lugaru HD</a>, <a href="http://www.penumbragame.com/">Penumbra Overture</a> and <a href="http://www.amanita-design.net/samorost-2/">Samorost 2</a>. The bundle was available for one week and the earnings went to the developers, The <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child&#8217;s Play Charit</a>y and <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> depending on the will of the buyer. At the end of the week the bundle reached 1&#8217;000.000 US$ of income, reason for which <a href="http://www.bit-blot.com/aquaria/">Aquaria</a>, <a href="http://www.crypticsea.com/gish/">Gish</a>, <a href="http://www.wolfire.com/lugaru">Lugaru HD</a> and <a href="http://www.penumbragame.com/">Penumbra Overture</a> are releasing their code under FLOSS licenses. As you can see <a href="http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/05/Lugaru-goes-open-source">here</a> was already released under GPL2, and the other games source code is being prepared to be released within this week.</p>
<p><img src="http://alexnevsky.com/articles/indie/images/aquaria.jpg" alt="" width="237" height="171" /> <img class="alignnone" src="http://www.downloadgames2008.com/pic/645Thumb2.jpg" alt="Gish" width="231" height="173" /> <img class="alignnone" src="http://www.wolfire.com/lugaru/screens/12.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="172" /> <img class="alignnone" src="http://www.manifestogames.com/system/files/images/overture_toilet.preview.jpg" alt="" width="228" height="170" /></p>
<p>In addition to this, it was <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=valve_steam_announcement&amp;num=1">officially</a> announced that Steam will be available for Linux at the end of this summer, which means lots of games and lots of fun is coming to gnu/linux and the breach in gaming between gnu/linux and other OSs is getting smaller.</p>
<p>Here some trailers of the games that will be released as FLOSS  from the Humble Indie Bundle</p>

            <p>Hello, and welcome. Here goes :</p>
<p>-This first one is hot after the closing of the last weeks&#8217; edition, courtesy of LWN.net (I had not access to vger.kernel.org because of their downtime) : Linus Torvalds announced 2.6.34-rc6  (http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/ChangeLog-2.6.34-rc6) and here is the link from LWN : http://lwn.net/Articles/385535/rss<br />
-On the fixes side, we begin with Trond Myklebust&#8217;s NFS client bugfixes , and continue with a small fix from Jens Axboe regarding the block tree; in related news, other fixes are : xfs (Alex Elder), kgdb for  -rc5 (Alex Elder), perf (Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo), spi/gpio (Grant Likely), USB for -rc4-git (Greg Kroah-Hartman), who also sent fixes for the tty and staging trees.<br />
-Stefan Bader announced linux-2.6.32.y-drm33.z with the following comment : &#8220;As many of us now have a distribution which is based on a 2.6.32 kernel but are forced to update DRM to the version in 2.6.33 to obtain good graphics experience. In support of this I went ahead and created a tree on kernel.org[1] which brings together the two and which I will maintain following the upstream stable trees from Greg. This hopefully will not only be beneficial to us but also to all that are in the need of running this combination of code.&#8221;<br />
-Tim Gardner of Canonical proposed some of the updates to the r8169 driver should be merged into stable; Francois Romieu agreed, so we&#8217;ll see these fixes in .32 and .33 stable versions.<br />
-Darrick j. Wong posted a RFC in regard of the ext4 tree with the following intro-duction : &#8220;Hmm.  A while ago I was complaining that an evil program that calls fsync() in a loop will send a continuous stream of write barriers to the hard disk.  Ted theorized that it might be possible to set a flag in ext4_writepage and clear it in ext4_sync_file; if we happen to enter ext4_sync_file and the flag isn&#8217;t set (meaning that nothing has been dirtied since the last fsync()) then we could skip issuing the barrier. Here&#8217;s an experimental patch to do something sort of like that.  From a quick run with blktrace, it seems to skip the redundant barriers and improves the ffsb mail server scores.  However, I haven&#8217;t done extensive power failure testing to see how much data it can destroy.  For that matter I&#8217;m not even 100% sure it&#8217;s correct at what it aims to do.&#8221;<br />
-John W. Linville asked Dave Miller to pull some of his fixes applied to the wireless-2.6 tree (30.04.2010).<br />
-Linux Weekly&#8217;s editor-in-chief, Jonathan Corbet, RFC&#8217;d some fixes for the viafb tree (OLPC).<br />
-Paul E. McKenney announced fixes for the RCU tree in .34 and changes for .35,  Frederic Weisbecker sent Ingo Molnar and the list some new fixes for perf,  lockdep and hw-breakpoints, Michael S. Tsirkin came up with vhost-net improvements,  just like Sage Weil, who posted ceph fixes for -rc7; other fixes include lockdep, RCU, i2c, tracing and core.<br />
-Joel Becker wrote fixes for the ocfs tree, while H. Peter Anvin posted x86 fixes for -rc7, including David Howell&#8217;s rwsem patch.<br />
-Another series of small fixes for the drm and gpu trees by Dave Airlie were  posted, as well as other fixes for the following trees/components :  input by Dmitry Torokhov, sound by Takashi Iwai, networking by David Miller, wq (workqueue) by Tejun Heo and perf by Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo.<br />
-Pankaj Thakkar of Vmware posted a RFC in regard of NPA for vmxnet3, with the  following words : &#8220;Device passthrough technology allows a guest to bypass the hypervisor and drive the underlying physical device. VMware has been exploring various ways to deliver this technology to users in a manner which is easy to adopt. In this process we have prepared an architecture along with Intel &#8211; NPA (Network Plugin Architecture). NPA allows the guest to use the virtualized NIC vmxnet3 to passthrough to a number of physical NICs which support it. The document below provides an overview of NPA. We intend to upgrade the upstreamed vmxnet3 driver to implement NPA so that Linux users can exploit the benefits provided by passthrough devices in a seamless manner while retaining the benefits of virtualization. The document<br />
below tries to answer most of the questions which we anticipated. Please let us know your comments and queries.&#8221;<br />
-On opensuse-kernel@ Larry Finger patched the script allowing the downloading of firmware for b43 (Broadcom).<br />
-Another series of fixes were posted as follows : SLAB for -rc7 by Pekka J. Enberg,  libata and zerolen (misc) by Jeff Garzik, RCU for 2.6.34 by Paul E. McKenney, sh by Paul MUndt, arch/microblaze by Michal Simek, oprofile by Robert Richter, RCU, this time by Ingo Molnar, vrl/dvb by Mauro Carvalho Chehab, nfs client  fixes by Trond Myklebust, sched/core by Tejun Heo, drm by Dave Airlie,  ACPI for -rc6 by Len Brown, perf and tracing by Steven Rostedt, block for 2.6.34 by Jens Axboe, PCMCIA by Dominic Brodowski and md for 2.6.34 by Neil Brown.<br />
-Soeren Sandmann announced the release of Sysprof 1.1.6 with the following  words : &#8220;Sysprof 1.1.6 is now available. This is a development release leading up to a stable 1.2.0 release. Sysprof is a sampling system-wide CPU profiler for Linux. This version is based on the perf counter interface in 2.6.31 kernels and will not work with earlier kernels.&#8221;<br />
-Mikulas Patocka asked for testers in the matter of performance degradation in the Maxtor Atlas 15K2 SCSI disks, due to buggy firmware, posting a script that limits the request size to 256k, since the degradation appears when requests exceed this 256k boundary<br />
That&#8217;s all, folks! If you&#8217;re in Europe, have a rainless weekend, and may all<br />
of you have a fantastic weekend!</p>

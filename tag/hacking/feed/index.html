				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6818" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/osc_plugin_and_lego.jpeg" alt="" width="161" height="207" /><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OSC">OSC</a> is a powerful tool for packaging experts, exposing all the latest and greats features of the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/">Build Service</a>. It&#8217;s written on python and easy in studying and using. However there are situations when its functionality is not enough; sometimes we need something special. In this case to us will help plug-in mechanism, which in osc is realised very simply.<br />
<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OSC_plugins">Plugin</a> can use all of the features, which already implemented osc, as well as provide an output in a convenient format for you. For example, if I want to check changes in kdelibs4 between openSUSE:11.3 and openSUSE:11.4, I can do something like this:</p>
<pre>&gt; osc rdiff openSUSE:11.3 kdelibs4 openSUSE:Factory kdelibs4</pre>
<p>After that I will receive a detailed output about all changes. Yes, that&#8217;s great… but not always it&#8217;s convenient. For example, in this case output will contain more than 2000 strings, and I need time to find, say, a *.changes file if I want quickly to understand that has been changed. In case if I want to transfer output to processing to another program (as often happens in practice), I have to shape this data. Unfortunately osc is not as intelligent and can&#8217;t show changes from one file (from *.changes, for example) only&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: right">Hello world</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s me show how we can create a very simple osc-plugin. In the derectory /var/lib/osc-plugins/ we create a new file tell_me_something.py with such content:</p>
<pre>@cmdln.alias('say')
def do_say_something(self, subcmd, opts, *args):
    if sys.argv[2] == "something":
        print "openSUSE rulezzz"
    else:
        print sys.argv[2]</pre>
<p>At start, osc will check this directory and will register all found there plugins. In that case, if in the plugin&#8217;s content there are errors, osc will report about it immediately. If now we run</p>
<pre>&gt; osc help</pre>
<p>we will see in the list our function <strong>say_something</strong> and the key to start it &#8211; <strong>say</strong>. Let&#8217;s test:</p>
<pre>&gt; osc say "hello"
hello
&gt; osc say GNU/Linux
GNU/Linux
&gt; osc say something
openSUSE rulezzz
&gt;</pre>
<p>As you can see, it&#8217;s very easy &#8211; just python and nothing else. Let&#8217;s go back to the output of the function rdiff(), which we mentioned at the beginning.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: right">show me changes</h2>
<p>In output of rdiff() nothing wrong, but I would like to immediately get information about what exactly has been done and, for example, which bugzilla-reports (related to this package) have been closed, etc. All what I need, are in rdiff&#8217;s output. It means that all what I have to do is just to shape this output.</p>
<p>In 40 minutes of hacking I got such output:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>this post is just request for all obs-packagers. Please, don&#8217;t forget write some documentation about your projects (which you maintain or develop). I mean, documentation for developers. This make more easy to understand logic of program, connection between some modules inside or interfaces between widget/applet and &#8220;system/hardware part&#8221;. For sure, comments in source code (or in changelog) help, but some times they give not so much clarity.</p>
<p>This is not so complicated to write one-two pages about project, which you hack. This also can save time of new developers. They will not ask you about architecture of project, and that will save your time too <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="&#x1f609;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how will be better to do it: use wiki (create a new page) or add just text-file in source project. Anyway it&#8217;s not so important where will be this documentation, main things that this documentation will be exist <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" src="http://techbase.kde.org/images.techbase/6/67/Plasma_logo.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="100" />On this week the leading KDE developers met <a href="http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Plasma/Tokamak4">together again</a>. This time it was held in Nürnberg, in the openSUSE premises and was kindly made possible by Novell and KDE e.V.<br />
26 hackers, who make KDE better.</p>
<p>For me it was first time, where I met hackers not for drinking a cup of beer, but for working, for hacking, for learning&#8230; and I think in this time I got much more fun.</p>
<p>We started at 9-10 am and finished it at 1-2 am. Yes, these two days we hacked like crazy. I&#8217;m not so good in KDE, I mean &#8211; I&#8217;m just trainee in SUSE/Novell, but in these two days I took a lot of information about KDE (arhitecture), Solid, Plasma, methods of project&#8217;s buildings (cmake), etc.</p>
<p>I have uploaded photos. You can find these <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/posix.ru/MeetTheKDEPlasmaDevelopersAtSUSE#">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/KDE_Plasma.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5445" src="http://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/KDE_Plasma.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="396" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/KDE_Plasma.jpg 650w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/KDE_Plasma-300x182.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>I have worked before on KNetworkManager. It was just a couple of patches (Qt/KDE3 based), and KNM has another aspects of integration with hardware as we have now in KDE4. In KDE4 we have <a href="http://solid.kde.org/">SOLID</a>, and this makes more easy to asking for such things like, for example, wired connection or to find hidden SSID wi-fi&#8230; </p>
<p>Yes, my current project is <a href="http://userbase.kde.org/NetworkManagement">Network Management</a> plasma applet.</p>
<p>With Sebastian Kügler and Will Stephenson, we worked together on functionality to easily connect to wired, wireless and mobile broadband networks and also to VPNs. As I said, I don&#8217;t did so much, but I started working on support for connection. Maybe next month I will be able to show that I did.</p>
<p>I would like to thank everyone with whom I spent those 2 days. Especially Will, who always supports and helps me to become a KDE developer.</p>

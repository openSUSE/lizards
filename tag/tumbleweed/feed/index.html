				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Long time not talking about fglrx rpm, mostly because they&#8217;ve got no update since last December 2015.</p>
<h3 style="color:red">Short Summary</h3>
<p>In a word as hundred, fglrx is now a dead horse!</p>
<p><img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/090214failsoftwaredevelopment-1234881541128932-3/95/090214-fail-software-development-6-728.jpg?cb=1234860218" alt="Dead horse" /></p>
<p>We had the hope of getting it working for Leap 42.2 in October, but except freezing kernel and xorg, you will not get what you would expect: a stable xorg session</p>
<p><strong>Say goodbye fglrx!, repeat after me, goodbye fglrx.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>If you are locked down and forced for any reasons to use fglrx with your gpu, and are still using 42.1, then don&#8217;t upgrade to 42.2, without a plan B</p></blockquote>
<p>It has no more support from AMD upstream, and that&#8217;s it!, if someone want to break its computer, it&#8217;s still possible to pick the last files and try it by yourself, but the repository will never contain it for 42.2 (see below how-to)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s said, I&#8217;m not still sure, to keep for a long time the repository, I&#8217;ve been managing since 6 years now.</p>
<h3>A bit of history</h3>
<p>In 2010, when we were working hard to get 11.1 out, the news that no supported ATI (at that time) will be available for end-users, as we have for nvidia gpu</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t check back the irc log, but we were a few, that would like to have this still available, by pure commodity. Especially that I&#8217;ve just exchanged a non working gpu by my new hd5750.</p>
<p>I remember the first chaotic steps, how to build that, and create repeating builds, what about the license? Did we have the right to offer a pre-build rpm etc. I spent some time fixing all of this stuff.<br />
And start the build on real hardware. Hey afterward kvm was really in infancy stage.
</p>
<p>Release after release amd/ati and openSUSE, the driver was build, on hardware for each supported distribution. When beginning of 2013 Sebastian Siebert, who got some direct contacts with AMD, release<br />
his own script, we collaborate to have the possibility to build on virtual machines, which allow me to simplify the build process, as having on kvm for each openSUSE release supported.
</p>
<p>Afterward, AMD start to split fglrx with the fglrx for HD5xx and above, and fglrx-legacy. So 2 drivers to maintain, but as always with proprietary software, the legacy version became rapidly obsolete,<br />
and non usable. Not that bad, in the meantime the AMD effort on the free and open source radeon driver, quickly overcome the performance of legacy.</p>
<p>Still from 2013, to 2016 I&#8217;ve been able to propose ready to use rpm for several version of openSUSE&#8217;s distributions. I think the repository serve quite well end users, and I never got big flames.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t avoid to mention the openSUSE powered server and sponsored by <a href="http://www.ioda-net.ch">Ioda-Net Sàrl</a> that has serve this objective so well during that time frame.</p>
<h3>Future of the repository</h3>
<p>Now that fglrx is becoming obsolete, I think seriously about why the repository online should stay online.</p>
<p>At openSUSE project level, we still have 13.1, 13.2, 42.1 and 42.2 that are mostly active. 13.1 is already almost out of the game of evergreen,<br />
13.2 will follow soon, and I don&#8217;t know yet the exact plan for 42.1, but it will certainly go out of maintenance in less than a year.
</p>
<p>If you feel or have the need of the repository, please express that in the comments below.</p>
<h3>Wait there&#8217;s amd-gpu-pro, no?</h3>
<p>Yeap there&#8217;s a closed driver, called amd-gpu-pro, available, for newer cards. But there&#8217;s two things that bring me out of the game, first I don&#8217;t have those newer gpu,<br />
and don&#8217;t have the need to replace my hd5750 for the moment. The second and certainly the most important, those drivers are only available for Ubuntu or at least in .deb format.</p>
<p>I will certainly not help proprietary crap, if I don&#8217;t have a solid base to work with, and a bit of help from their side. I wish good luck to those who want to try those drivers,<br />
I&#8217;ve got a look inside, and got a blame face.</p>
<h3>For crazy, and those who don&#8217;t love their computer</h3>
<p>So you want to loose your time? you can! I&#8217;ve kept <a href="http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/amd-fglrx/raw-src">in raw-src directory</a> all the script used to build the driver.<br />
They differ a bit compared to <a href="http://www.sebastian-siebert.de/">Sebastian Siebert last version</a> in the sense of making Leap 422 as a possible target.<br />
If you dig a bit around, you should be able to build them, but you&#8217;re alone on that way, you&#8217;ve been warned!
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not against a republished version, if someone find a way to make them working, just drop me a message.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for this journey, Have Fun! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>On November 16th there was the release of <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2016/11/16/optimal-release-for-linux-professionals-arrives-with-opensuse-leap-42-2/" target="1">openSUSE Leap 42.2</a>. On November 24th, I had the opportunity to present openSUSE Project at school.</p>
<p>I was asked to make an introduction to FLOSS in general and more specific about openSUSE Project. The school was for middle aged people, for persons who quited school to work and conftibute financially to their families. There were 3 classes that they taught something computer related. It was a great opportunity for them to learn what FLOSS is and what makes openSUSE great Linux distro.<br />
<span id="more-12138"></span><br />
I busted the myth that &#8220;Linux is hard because you have to be a hacker, it&#8217;s terminal operated&#8221; I showed them how to install openSUSE Leap step by step (pictures) and also how to use GNOME (pictures). I mentioned our tools to make a very stable distro and finally I showed them that it&#8217;s not only a distro but there are people (the communtity) that take care of the software.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a8n4panlnvm1fkl/presentation.jpg?raw=1" target="1"><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/a8n4panlnvm1fkl/presentation.jpg?raw=1" width="70%" height="70%"></a></p>
<p>There were plenty of questions about linux software alternatives, how to install, if they can replace Ubuntu/Windows with openSUSE and what is perfect suit for specific systems. Each student took a DVD with stikers and a card with Greek community information. Professors will organize an install fest for their lab and/or laptops of their students.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Douglas DeMaio for managing to send me DVDs and stickers and Alexandros Mouhtsis that managed with his professors to organize this presentation. Finally, I would like to thank <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/146573897@N06" target="1">Dimitrios Katsikas</a> for taking pictures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since some months ago, the YaST Team at SUSE has been using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a> to organize the work. Among other things, that means the whole team takes part in a review meeting every three weeks to showcase the fixed bugs and the implemented features. To support those review meetings we often create screenshots, text summaries, short videos and other material. Is it not a pity that all that content get unnoticed for curious users and potential contributors?</p>
<p>In order to give the SUSE and openSUSE communities an opportunity to lurk into those review meetings, we have decided to create this team blog and post here the highlights after every meeting. Not all the fixes and features will be covered, but we&#8217;ll try to blog about the most exciting or relevant changes.</p>
<p>Obviously, many of those posts will be more exciting for developers and Tumbleweed users than for users of the stable release (bugfixes tend to be unexciting). But, as some kind of bonus track, Leap 42.1 users can always revisit the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Features#openSUSE_technologies">summary of what the recent release brought</a> to the YaST (and friends) world.</p>
<p>The current sprint ends right before Christmas, so stay tuned!</p>

<h1 style="color:red">Tumbleweed beware : broken Xorg</h1>
<p>It seems since the release, that a number of report of broken xorg with gdm, ssdm and so&#8230; segfaulting</p>
<p>You can still use the previous version hanging on the server. But I doubt it would work better</p>
<p>As soon, with Sebastian Siebert we have a patch for, I will republish a new build</p>

<p>If you have any problems with the driver, don&#8217;t be afraid to report to Sebastian (German and English bugreports are gladly accepted).<br />
he will try, as far as I am able to reproduce the bug. Together with the necessary system information, he will go directly to the right place at AMD to have the bug fixed in the next driver release.<br />
Thank you very much, Sebastian.
</p>
<p>See below what to do in case of troubles.</p>
<p>Or you can also ping him on irc (freespacer)</p>
<h4>Debugging troubles</h4>
<p>I recommend in case of trouble the use of <a href="http://www.sebastian-siebert.de/downloads/makerpm-amd-15.11.sh">his script</a> which can collect the whole informations needed to help you. then you just have to issue a simple commande in console to collect all informations, you can review them, and finally transmit them.<br />
Check the website to get the latest.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AMD has released the new AMD Catalyst 15.11 (Radeon Crimson Edition). My script replaces the existing packaging script with an updated packaging script. It supports up to Kernel 4.4. (Official support up to Kernel 3.19)</p>
<p>I have adapted the AMD driver to the Kernel 4.4 (rc3). For the moment it works for Kernel 4.4-rc3. Unfortunately the AMD driver has a compatibility issue in combination with the GNOME Desktopmanager and X-Server. As a workaround, I recommend for GNOME another Desktopmanager such as lightdm until the issue is hopefully fixed.</p>
<p>Resolved Issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>[SWDEV-55204] Stuttering when running glxgears with VSync enabled</li>
<li>[SWDEV-7339] Intermittent mouse cursor corruption</li>

<p>The 8th Free and Open Source Software Communities Meeting (<a href="http://fosscomm.teiath.gr/" target="_blank">FOSSCOMM</a>) took place in Athens (Greece), November 6-8th 2015 at the <a href="http://www.teiath.gr/articles.php?id=98&amp;lang=el" target="_blank">Technical Educational Institute of Athens</a>.</p>
<p>The Conference started early on Saturday morning welcoming the participants and with the key note. Various presentations about open source software, hardware constructions and some workshops took place. Presentations such as Raspberry Pi arcade, openstack, OSGeo, ownCloud, Bitcoin and many more were quite interested by the visitors.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0716" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/eiosifidis/22316436533/in/album-72157660299594107/"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/670/22316436533_ee99406122_n.jpg" alt="DSC_0716" width="320" height="213" /></a></p>
<p>Greek openSUSE community was there with a booth and some presentations. On Saturday Alex P. Natsios presented “Enlightment on openSUSE”, an alternative GUI, and the other presentation was about “openQA”. Since openSUSE Leap 42.1 was very fresh, Alexandros Vennos took the opportunity to present what are openSUSE Leap 42.1 and Tumbleweed, the differences and what to install on what occasions. Presentation had title “openSUSE – Leaping Ahead”.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0709" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/eiosifidis/22911595656/in/album-72157660299594107/"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5644/22911595656_3e32100290_n.jpg" alt="DSC_0709" width="320" height="213" /></a></p>
<p>The booth was quite crowded. We had some left over DVDs of 13.2 but we proposed the visitors to install Leap 42.1. The question we were asked most was what is the difference between openSUSE Leap and Tubleweed and why to install and on what ocasion. We even created couple of bootable USBs from the ISOs of Leap. We had a Banana Pi running Tumbleweed with MATE playing a video loop of openSUSE Leap 42.1 KDE review. We gave almost all of our promo materials to the visitors since they were interested on openSUSE.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AMD has released the new AMD Catalyst 15.9. My script replaces the existing packaging script with an updated packaging script. It supports up to Kernel 4.2. (Official support up to Kernel 3.19)</p>
<p>Important note: The first beta version of openSUSE Leap (future openSUSE 42.1) was released a few days ago. However, the AMD driver has not been adapted yet to the new upcoming openSUSE version. In the next days I will working on this and release a new update for this script.</p>
<p>Important note 2: After some experimentation with the GNOME Desktopmanager, unfortunately it does not work with the driver. Because actually something seems to be amiss. To this end, I will contact the AMD developers. As a workaround, I recommend for GNOME another Desktopmanager such as lightdm until the issue is fixed.</p>
<p>Resolved Issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>[425910] Driver installation sometimes fails on Ubuntu 14.04.3</li>
<li>[424450] Company of Heroes® 2 &#8211; Game crashes while running the performance test</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know <a title="Losah" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Losah">I&#8217;m old losah</a>! Nowadays it&#8217;s all about pads, phones and mobile this and mobile that. Install some cool stuff from app store and start mangling. I was amused how much you can do with these small entertainment units but then comes small detail that is not that cool <a title="Most popular Apple App Store categories in September 2014, by share of available apps" href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/270291/popular-categories-in-the-app-store/">over 20% stuff that is downloaded from Apple store is games and those neat utilities are just 5%</a>. I don&#8217;t know what education means but it&#8217;s after games so I think it&#8217;s good thing. What I&#8217;m trying to say stop playing for a while (it&#8217;s good thing to do. Don&#8217;t get me wrong), put pad/phone down and look around what kind of world we are living in 2014.</p>
<h2>Nah Open Source/Free Software doesn&#8217;t matter anyway</h2>
<p>In year 2014 wasn&#8217;t just year on Linux getting <a title=" Tech More: Apple Android iOS Google The iPhone 6 Had Better Be Amazing And Cheap, Because Apple Is Losing The War To Android  Read more: http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-v-android-market-share-2014-5" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-v-android-market-share-2014-5?IR=T">into you hands as Android</a>. It was strange year in Linux land. Probably biggest Linux hater from Redmond that called <a title="Linux is cancer" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/">Linux Cancer</a> said &#8216;<a title="Microsoft: It's TIME at LAST. Yes - .NET is going OPEN and X-PLATFORM" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/11/12/microsoft_to_open_source_dot_net/">hey Free Software and Open Source are cool!</a> <a title="Audio nerds rejoice: Windows 10 will get support for playing FLAC files next year" href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/26/windows-10-will-get-flac-support-next-year-on-top-of-mkv-and-hevc-additions/">We take cherrys</a> like Apple and sell them to you in nice package and there nothing wrong with that (And I&#8217;m with them.. it&#8217;s what they can do if you buy it)&#8217;. Small IoT (Internet-Of-Things, Industrial Internet or choose your favorite term) ARM SOC boards are so Nineties. MIPS made proud comeback! <a title="MIPS instruction set" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_instruction_set">Once it was SGI&#8217;s own bitch</a> but now there is <a title="MIPS Takes on ARM in the Internet of Things" href="http://www.linux.com/news/embedded-mobile/mobile-linux/777166-mips-takes-on-arm-internet-of-things/">growing mass of small very cheap wireless boards started to flow in</a>. All supporting Linux and most have also Android. Targeted to next big thing that you are doing when not playing.</p>
<p>In Finland where I&#8217;m located this have been year of economical rumble (read economical crash). Mass layoffs, industrial work places are getting rare and <a title="Microsoft officially welcomes the Nokia Devices and Services business" href="http://news.microsoft.com/2014/04/25/microsoft-officially-welcomes-the-nokia-devices-and-services-business/">Nokia was sold to that huge firm from Redmond</a>. Selling Nokia out was end of Finland&#8217;s mobile dreams as they <a title="Nokia N1" href="http://n1.nokia.com/en">now have new tablet</a> and fear not also <a title="Be a part of making the world’s first people powered tablet, running Sailfish OS 2.0" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jolla-tablet-world-s-first-crowdsourced-tablet">Jolla is launching their new shiny Sailfish tablet</a> and got very good funding through indie-go-go. Ok nobody really wants this tablet because of Android but it&#8217;s good to see there is guys and girls that still think with punk attitude and believe that very small firm like Jolla can produce something that big players can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Year 2014 also was big climate is changing year. USA and China make promise to cut their <a title="US and China strike deal on carbon cuts in push for global climate change pact " href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/12/china-and-us-make-carbon-pledge">carbon dioxide emission till 2030</a>. USA will do something and China says their peak will be 2030. Does this stop global warming probably not but at least now it&#8217;s official that climate is changing. How this is relevant with Linux? <a title="Supercomputer Update: Climate Models and a CO2 Snapshot " href="http://climatecrocks.com/2014/11/22/supercomputer-update-climate-models-and-a-co2-snapshot/">Most of these calculation are done in &#8216;super computers&#8217;</a> and those <a title="Linux dominates supercomputers as never before" href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-dominates-supercomputers-as-never-before/">run tadaaaa&#8230; Linux</a>. They don&#8217;t run Fedora or openSUSE because they are mostly very fast calculators but they run Linux kernel and something that as immortals never will know because most of them doesn&#8217;t calculate climate change things. They calculate nuclear war scenarios. <a title="War games" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/quotes">Hello Dr. Falken shall we play a game</a>? <a title="HP’s ‘The Machine’ &amp; the Future of Linux" href="http://fossforce.com/2014/12/hps-the-machine-the-future-of-linux/">Linux++ and HP Machine anyone</a>?</p>
<p>Firefox which is <a title="As Firefox turns 10, Mozilla introduces new ‘Forget Button’ and launches Developer Edition browser" href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/11/10/firefox-turns-10-mozilla-introduces-new-forget-button-launches-developer-focused-browser/">now 10 years</a> old. They broke up with Google because as you can see they don&#8217;t need that search flow anymore. Firefox <a title="New Search Strategy for Firefox: Promoting Choice &amp; Innovation" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/11/19/promoting-choice-and-innovation-on-the-web/">preset for searching in USA is now Yahoo, Russian Yandex and China Baidu</a>. Mozilla also made bold moves with <a title="Firefox OS" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/">Firefox OS</a> in 2014. <a title="List of Firefox OS devices" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Firefox_OS_devices">More phones</a> and if you need low end cheap phone so <a title="With Firefox OS, Mozilla begins the $25 smartphone push" href="http://www.cnet.com/news/with-firefox-os-mozilla-begins-the-25-smartphone-push/">you should consider Firefox OS phone 25$ that is very cheap</a>.</p>
<h2>So what happened in Linux land</h2>
<p>openSUSE made only <a title="openSUSE Roadmap" href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap">one release 13.2</a> but then rumbled big changes in. openSUSE is also catching up popular rolling release method like Arch Linux with Tumbleweed but this year openSUSE<a title="Factory moves to Rolling Release Development Model" href="https://news.opensuse.org/2014/07/29/factory-rolling-release/"> upstream Factory also become a rolling release</a> and then<a title="openSUSE Factory &amp; Tumbleweed Are Merging" href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTgyMjA"> it get together with Tumbleweed</a>. It&#8217;s good thing! Really things get tested and traditional releases are more stable. Hooray for that. There was and gigantic war against <a title="XLennart" href="https://github.com/Xylemon/xlennart">systemd</a> and you can start sending me millions of hate mails for a start because<strong> I Like it</strong>! It&#8217;s modern and does everything that was wrong with Linux init. No more big tune this tune that complex learn curve up to your a** stuff very neat simple configuration. Ok it&#8217;s bloat.. but why don&#8217;t you start hating Linux kernel. It&#8217;s not very UNIX nether it&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t just one thing like BSD micro-kernel approach. But that is what I wanted to say about that. If you fork <a title="Devuan" href="https://devuan.org/">Debian just to have Sysvinit</a> I think you are little bit over reacting but best luck to you I&#8217;m nothing but thumbs up get it rolling! At the end this feels like Pulseaudio hating campaign. Everybody hated it first but now nobody even notices that they are using it.</p>
<p>Also it <a title="Can we please stop talking about the Linux desktop?" href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/can-we-please-stop-talking-about-the-linux-desktop/">becomes clear 2014 that Desktop Linux will never come</a>. Time just passed by and people moved to other things and we have desktop Linux <a title="Best Chromebooks 2014" href="http://blog.laptopmag.com/best-chromebooks">Google&#8217;s Chromebooks</a>. In year 2014 <a title="No, you didn’t miss it: Samsung’s Tizen phone delayed yet again" href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-z1-tizen-launch/">It also becomes clear that nor Tizen</a> or <a title="Ubuntu Phone" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/phone">Ubuntu phone</a> will be huge success at least it takes little bit longer. My hope is that X will die in great crash of meteorite or let me rephrase how about <a title="Wayland news 2014" href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_topic&amp;q=Wayland">Wayland project</a> will never take X-windows place and things never become sweet again. Canonical  shiny move with <a title="Mir Display Server" href="http://unity.ubuntu.com/mir/">Mir display server</a> will shake things up if it becomes successful. Time will tell how things end up will Mir be successor of X or should it be Wayland?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Christmas time around! AMD give us a new version of fglrx, and Sebastian Siebert just release his script yesterday night.<br />
So I&#8217;ve prepared the new version available for openSUSE 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 13.1, 13.2 and Tumbleweed.<br />
Sebastian&#8217;s script contain a special patch for supporting kernel up to 3.17 and 3.18 version.<br />
I should also share Sebastian&#8217;s surprize about the fact that this version didn&#8217;t got a beta/rc cycle&#8230;.
</p>
<p>I hope this release will give better results for all of you who own an apu (especially the recent one), and also fix a number of issue with the hybrid chipset intel cpu/amd gpu embedded.<br />
<br />See below how to report issue on Sebastian blog.
</p>
<p><strong>It will be the last build for all openSUSE version below 13.1</strong> (except if patches are needed).<br />
In January 12.3 support will definitively end. But I will let the drivers as is so you can still use them in case of.</p>
<h3>Installation / update</h3>
<p>Please refer to the wiki page <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AMD_fglrx">SDB:AMD_fgrlx</a></p>
<h3>New packaging schema</h3>
<p>The driver is now splitted into different rpm that all need to be installed. Normally the necessary Require field is there and should happen automatically.</p>
<p>My advise is to check if you have them all installed.</p>
<p><strong>for 32 bits</strong></p>
<pre>
zypper install fglrx_xpic fglrx_core fglrx_graphics fglrx_amdcccle fglrx_opencl
</pre>
<p><strong>for 64 bits</strong></p>
<pre>
zypper install fglrx64_xpic fglrx64_core fglrx64_graphics fglrx64_amdcccle fglrx64_opencl
</pre>
<h3>A notice for Tumbleweed users</h3>
<p>The new release has now its package correctly named, previously they were called SUSEFACTORY, with the new version the package will contain SUSETUMBLEWEED in their name</p>

<h4>Sebastien Siebert making script</h4>

<p>Damn I&#8217;m impressed by the number of steam games tested there, I should try some of them during hollidays <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>If you have any problems with the driver, don&#8217;t be afraid to report to Sebastian (German and English bugreports are gladly accepted).<br />
he will try, as far as I am able to reproduce the bug. Together with the necessary system information, he will go directly to the right place at AMD to have the bug fixed in the next driver release.<br />
Thank you very much, Sebastian.

<h3>Reminder this drivers is only for radeon HD5xxx</h3>
<p>This release concern only owners of radeon HD5xxx or above.<br />
For older gpu, the fglrx-legacy is still there see wiki page at<a href="http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:AMD_fglrx_legacy">SDB:AMD_fgrlx_legacy</a>.<br />
Beware of it obsolete status, and prefer the free open-source radeon driver which came out of the box from your openSUSE distribution.<br />
For 12.3, and more true with 13.1+ the free radeon often offer a better experience than the old fglrx-legacy, especially for HD2xxx-HD4xxx range.
</p>
<h2>Humor : the never ending links</h2>
<p>In 2014 April, I&#8217;ve decided to close the automatic redirection of http://geeko.ioda.net/mirror/ati after being obsolete for more than one year.<br />
The reason was that there&#8217;s no safe way to drive people having a older Radeon HD card (series 2xxx to 4xxxx) to not use newer fglrx build.<br />
<br />
Guess what? I&#8217;m still seeing more than quarter billion hit on those address (for 12.1 to 13.1) <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="&#x1f642;" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />

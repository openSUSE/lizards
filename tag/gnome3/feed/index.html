				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was brought to my attention through I <a href="http://karl-tux-stadt.de/ktuxs/?p=3176" target="_blank">article</a> (german) the existence of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gpick/" target="_blank">gpick</a>, an advanced and high featured color picker. I&#8217;ve taken a quick look at it to make it available for openSUSE as it seems an interesting tool for artists and web designers (maybe GTK3+ themers) and others.</p>
<p>To build this package a few files are generated with the <a href="http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/" target="_blank">Lemon Parser Generator</a> which isn&#8217;t really available. I&#8217;m contacting upstream regarding the possibility of including the generated files in the tarball, or eventually if that fails, I&#8217;ll probably need to include lemon.c, hand compile it and hack scons build to use the local binary to generate those files.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The screenshots have a tiny glitch on an icon, this is mainly because I haven&#8217;t rebuilt the icon cache when I took them. I look forward to explore the possibility of having such a great tool available for openSUSE 12.1.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I&#8217;ve made available a small test package on <strong><a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Aketheriel%3Agpick" target="_blank">home:ketheriel:gpick</a></strong> (needs some work before submitting to factory) which should be working. Any testing/feedback will be most welcomed. Also enabled builds for Fedora 14, since I believe this package isn&#8217;t available for Fedora.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>For some time I wanted to check out GNOME3 and gnome-shell&#8230; My current chipset is ATI M92 RV710 and while the thermal performance with the proprietary driver is somewhat what I expect, the open source radeon driver does overheat my laptop a lot compared to flgrx. For the time being, fglrx isn&#8217;t really a choice because it just borgs the &#8216;activities&#8217; bar on top&#8230; And until ATI fixes their driver, there&#8217;s no other choice than running with the standard radeon drm driver, which does provide a very pleasant experience with GNOME3 / gnome-shell.</p>
<p>For all that matters, KMS is to be enabled, period, full stop. And from this point&#8230; we have two options regarding power management:</p>
<p>1. Dynamic Frequency switching (not really working for me);<br />
2. Profile based frequency switching (does provide what I need);</p>
<p>For all that matters regarding &#8216;profile based frequency switching&#8217; we have 5 profiles available:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;default&#8221; uses the default clocks and does not change the power state. This is the default behavior.</li>
<li>&#8220;auto&#8221; selects between &#8220;mid&#8221; and &#8220;high&#8221; power states based on the whether the system is on battery power or not. The &#8220;low&#8221; power state are selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.</li>
<li>&#8220;low&#8221; forces the gpu to be in the low power state all the time. Note that &#8220;low&#8221; can cause display problems on some laptops; this is why auto only uses &#8220;low&#8221; when displays are off.</li>
<li>&#8220;mid&#8221; forces the gpu to be in the &#8220;mid&#8221; power state all the time. The &#8220;low&#8221; power state is selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.</li>
<li>&#8220;high&#8221; forces the gpu to be in the &#8220;high&#8221; power state all the time. The &#8220;low&#8221; power state is selected when the monitors are in the dpms off state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, what I did might not be an option to everyone, but for sure it does provide a nice solution for my problem&#8230; So be mindful of that&#8230; this is a personal preference based on the fact that I don&#8217;t require intensive GPU usage, neither I run intensive GPU requiring applications within GNOME3/gnome-shell (I have a normal openSUSE 11.4 with GNOME 2.32.x with fglrx dual boot config for those apps).</p>
<p>The first thing we might want to do is to switch to profile based frequency switching&#8230; how do we this? As root:</p>
<p>[code] echo profile &gt; /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_method[/code]</p>
<p>Now we have to pick one of those 5 profiles&#8230; and since I&#8217;ve already stated&#8230; I want the &#8216;low&#8217; profile since I don&#8217;t really do much intensive GPU work&#8230;</p>
<p>[code] echo low &gt; /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_profile[/code]</p>
<p>Now&#8230; you might want to check out the different profiles and the different clocks used&#8230; this can be done through:</p>
<p>[code] ﻿cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/radeon_pm_info[/code]</p>
<p>and will report something like this:</p>
<p>[code]﻿linux-331w:~ # cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/radeon_pm_info<br />
default engine clock: 680000 kHz<br />
current engine clock: 299530 kHz<br />
default memory clock: 800000 kHz<br />
current memory clock: 249750 kHz<br />
voltage: 900 mV<br />
PCIE lanes: 16[/code]</p>
<p>This one is using the &#8216;low&#8217; profile&#8230; Feel free to test stuff around and find which one better answers your needs&#8230; Also there&#8217;s far more that can be done&#8230; I hope this helps ATI users with DRM driver to bring out the best of your system and improves your GNOME3 / gnome-shell experience, at so that you can run it with good thermal performance without fglrx.</p>
<p>NM</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<p>Some brief updates about the ongoing work towards bringing Ayatana Project software into openSUSE:</p>
<p><strong>1. Software Updates</strong></p>
<p>Canonical recently released a batch of updates which bring new functionality (Indicators seem to respond faster now) and very nice improvements, some of them contributed by down-streamers. From my humble experience I would risk to claim that Canonical is doing an excellent job as an upstreamer. I&#8217;ve updated all packages to the latest versions. This allowed to remove some patches.</p>
<p><strong>2. Unity</strong></p>
<p>Unity is now one step closer. For Unity I&#8217;ve started to package Compiz git snapshots from the correct branches pointed by Unity documentation. This brought something new to me, cmake. I&#8217;ve done this very slowly, reading some docs meanwhile about cmake. My packaging around Compiz is mainly based on OBS X11:Compiz repository, so pretty much all the credits should be for the original project Packagers which done an awesome job. Currently I&#8217;m missing only 3 packages to test Unity. Recently with kernel and mesa updates some issues around ATI hardware seem to have fixed for openSUSE Factory users, which enabled in my case FireGL, therefore I can test properly Unity now and check for the integration into openSUSE.</p>
<p>Unity by default uses the Ayatana&#8217;s Indicators, and if they are not present, it will fallback to GNOME&#8217;s applets. This is very nice and I&#8217;m thankful Canonical made it this way. This brings non-Ubuntu users the Unity experience at almost no trouble, since there isn&#8217;t actually much patching required to implement Unity.</p>
<p><strong>3. GNOME:Ayatana Repository</strong></p>
<p>GNOME:Ayatana Repository will be populated during the next two weeks with the latest changes and will provide for the time being the Ayatana&#8217;s Indicators and Unity. I am currently working around libappindicator stack and it&#8217;s Indicators. Currently I&#8217;m testing the patches required on the GTK+ stack and this is pretty much the last barrier before going into #STAGE2, polishing and populating GNOME:Ayatana.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not decided yet what packages are going to present on Factory. My wish is to push only Unity into Factory and it&#8217;s dependencies, this might not happen for 11.4 as I&#8217;m not sure about the freeze schedules and it might be too late already, but since we&#8217;re depending on Compiz upstream, we&#8217;ll see what happens. Even if Unity isn&#8217;t going to be available on Factory, I&#8217;m sure we can use KIWI or SUSE Studio to release a small openSUSE Unity Spin.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also decided that I (typo: previously would) <strong>wouldn&#8217;t</strong> like to see Unity available by openSUSE before the official release from Ubuntu, for which I wish all the success.</p>
<p>Since the very early start that I&#8217;ve been using pkg-config as much as I can. According to some information that I collected previously, this would be great for cross-distribution build. Depending on the time and work done, I might make the necessary modifications and enable cross-distribution building on this project, thus, making it available for other RPM distributions supported by OBS. This will require a bit of testing before, so it will be work to be done after 11.4 is released and during it&#8217;s lifecycle. Maybe by the time of openSUSE 12 gets released, we will have this project also available for other RPM based distributions. I have no knowledge on Debian packaging, but Ubuntu ships this software and Debian probably has it also available so&#8230; that won&#8217;t be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>4. Artwork</strong></p>
<p>I am providing on GNOME:Ayatana Ubuntu&#8217;s Light Themes (Ambiance and Radiance) and offering a patched version of Metacity that renders those themes perfectly. I&#8217;m not changing the original colors from the themes or modifying them in any way. So they might be a bit more of orange and not green.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve contacted some people to ask if they would be willing to donate some artwork to make a small package with Wallpapers, some have answered yes, so I will make a small package with a couple of wallpapers for the traditional resolutions and distribute it alongside with this software as optional as always.</p>
<p><strong>5. GTK2, GTK3 and QT</strong></p>
<p>Implementation of GTK3 will be done within the next days, as I am also considering enabling QT support for KDE users (Indicators only for now).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much the result of the last days of work&#8230; more news to come in the nearby future.</p>

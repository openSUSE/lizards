            <p>FLISoL 2010 at Ciudad del Saber looked good with several Linux Distributions and different open source applications. It was a small building with a lot people in transit. With three people and only two months to organize this event it was a successful achievement because our goal was accomplished: be on the eyes of governmental organizations, ONG, business, academics, students, users, professionals. Some media communications groups give some interviews. After this event we are receiving more invitations to give a talks for education and participate on some projects than ever before.  Click on link below to watch the photos</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>A little more than two weeks ago we released <a href="http://volle-kraft-voraus.de">Kraft</a> <a href="http://volle-kraft-voraus.de/Main/Releases">version 0.40</a>, the first version of Kraft based on <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE 4</a> software platform. The release went fine as far as I can tell, no terrible bugs were reported yet. Some work went into the <a href="http://volle-kraft-voraus.de">new website</a> since then, but in general I need a few weeks break from Kraft and spend my evenings outside enjoying spring time.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="http://sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</a> posted a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/blog/kraft-helps-small-businesses-manage-their-work/">blog about Kraft</a> after they kind of mail-interviewed me. It&#8217;s nice, it really focuses on the things also important to me. This might be another step towards a broader user base for Kraft. I say that because one could have the impression that the number of people actually really using Kraft could be larger. A high number of users is one of the fundamental criteria for a successful free software project and thus I am constantly trying to understand whats the reason for the impression or the fact.</p>
<p>The first idea is that the Kraft project simply does something wrong in the way a project should be driven. But there are releases, there is a so far ok website, there are communication channels with information on it and people answering questions. Of course, it always could be done better, but I hope and believe we are not doing too bad. Marketing could be more, that&#8217;s granted.</p>
<p>The next thing could be that nobody needs this kind of software. But there are quite some companies doing this kind of software in the commercial space. So there must be a market. Actually I think the market is huge. People are writing invoices all over the world and I bet many of them are not really satisfied with the way they do it usually which makes Kraft at least an option to try for them.</p>
<p>And this might lead to better path: Probably these people do not know that the option exists. They simply haven&#8217;t heard about Kraft yet and if they would there is a good chance that they would not believe that it is free etc pp. And this is probably not specific to Kraft but also applies, of course much more weaker, to larger projects like <a href="http://www.opensuse.org">openSUSE</a> or <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a>: A lot of people from the &#8216;real world&#8217; don&#8217;t know about free software communities, the ideas behind and the benefits for users of the software. That sounds strange to us, as this is our daily reality, but start with asking your parents or non computer related friends if they really understand what it is about.  Imagine what people know who have no computer job nor -hobby nor know you!</p>
<p>What consequences can that have for us? Well, we could decide to skip this group of people. That would mean, beside some other effects, that Kraft would not make sense any more and I don&#8217;t like that. It probably should influence the way we see the &#8216;product management&#8217; aspect of our projects. For me, &#8216;product management&#8217; is often equivalent to &#8220;take care that the result is especially useful to non computer scientists&#8221; (which is probably not what PM really is about) and the focus on that is very important and the precondition for the next point.</p>
<p>We might have to take our projects even more out of the geek niche and go to places where the &#8216;real world&#8217; happens. That is difficult for various reasons. First, it means that we have to start to explain again from start, and maybe also get questions where the answer is not obvious. Furthermore it might have practical issues, because for example fairs for handcrafter utilities charge seriously for software boothes which is not the case if we present projects on FOSS events.<br />
On the other hand its easy because we all just have to spread the word even more and tell everybody about free software, our projects and free culture. And try to think as if we weren&#8217;t free software people. I know, most of us do already what they can and that&#8217;s great <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

            <p>Guest Blog from:  Rares Aioanei &lt;suse.listen@gmail.com&gt;</p>
<p>Hi everyone, and welcome to this week&#8217;s edition of the kernel news &#8211; OpenSUSE style! The news are as follows :<br />
-Ryusuke Konishi pushed some trivial fixes to the NILFS2 tree (mostly fixing of typos)<br />
-Masami Hiramatsu posted a patch regarding perf-probe. In his own words, &#8220;This series improves data structure accessing.<br />
In this version, I added &#8216;removing x*()&#8217;patches.&#8221;<br />
-Chris Mason posted some improvements in the btrfs-unstable tree, among others fixing an oops and other impovements.<br />
-Linus Torvalds announced the release of the 2.6.34-rc4 kernel : &#8220;It&#8217;s been two weeks rather than the usual one, because we&#8217;ve been hunting<br />
a really annoying VM regression that not a lot of people seem to have<br />
seen, but I didn&#8217;t want to release an -rc4 with it. So we had the choice<br />
of either reverting all the anon-vma scalability improvements, or finding<br />
out exactly what caused the regression and fixing it.&#8221;<br />
This rc also contains various bugfixes and changes regarding drivers &#8211; a new network driver (cxbg4) and updates to radeon and nouveau.<br />

and lwn.net : http://lwn.net/Articles/383199/rss<br />
-Also, Luis R. Rodriguez announced an updated wireless tree in regard of the release of 2.6.34-rc4 (backported).<br />
See it here : http://www.orbit-lab.org/kernel/compat-wireless-2.6-stable/v2.6.34/compat-wireless-2.6.34-rc4.tar.bz2<br />
-David Miller posted various fixes in the networking- and sparc trees.<br />
-Michal Simek wrote to celebrate one year of Linux on the Microblaze (Tuesday, the 13th of April 2010)<br />
-And some news from the opensuse-kernel team :<br />
Jiri Kosina noticed that commit 5246824c7ea3313c8e4f42f9b19d9e6f0b51861a introduced CONFIG_DEBUG_BLOCK_EXT_DEVT as set on master kernels<br />
(non-{debug,trace} kernels). The problem has been solved and now this option is disabled on master kernels.<br />
This has a related fix upstream introduced by Rafael J. Wysocki.<br />
-Steven Rostedt announced the release of trace-cmd version 1.0<br />
-Trond Myklebust announced fixes for the nfs tree.<br />
-Jean Delvare posted fixes for the hwmon (hardware monitoring) tree for the upcoming 2.6.34 kernel<br />
-Ingo Molnar posted fixes for the perf tree including build fixes on Debian and others.<br />
-Douglas Gilbert announced sdparm 1.05 as of 15.04.<br />
-Stephen Rothwell announced that Thursday&#8217;s linux-next (next-20100415) will be the last until the 27th of April, when he&#8217;ll return from his vacation.<br />
-Dmitry Torokhov posted updates for the input tree for -rc4.<br />
-Also Thomas Gleixner mailed some updates for x86-fixes.<br />
-Fixes to the Firewire tree, along with documentation updates, were pushed by Stefan Richter.<br />
-John W. Linville posted a pull request for the wireless tree intended for<br />
2.6.34 .<br />
-Also, patches of mmotm have been released against 2.6.34-rc4 .<br />
-Guilt v0.33 is available as of 16.04.2010 .<br />
-Patches for bkl/ioctl, sound (for -rc5), watchdog have been released .</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>I want to share some ideas about the success of the Russian openSUSE community, and try to answer the question about its <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Statistics">popularity</a>. As you can see it is one of the top places:</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/russian_comminity.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5369" src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/russian_comminity.jpeg" alt="" width="657" height="369" /></a></p>
<p>The reason for the high popularity of this distribution in Germany is of course the fact that the German SuSE distribution and the main branch of development is located in Nuremberg. Popularity in the U.S. is due Novell &#8211; an American company, and of course the language is English. But why are so many people in Russia choosing openSUSE?</p>
<p>Good question. One of the main things that influence the choice of distribution &#8211; the quality and localization. The global community plays a top role for quality of distribution and local make it appropriate for Russian language users (of course a local community can be as part of a global community).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://thefreecountry.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/opensuse_rtt.png" alt="" width="400" height="110" /></p>
<p>Perhaps most important is the documentation. And of course, not everyone wants (or can) read the documentation in English. Everyone wants to read the documentation in their native language. The distribution may be in a good shape and stable, nice and convenient, but without documentation it will use very few. Translated documentation is very important to the community. The translation must have a high quality, understandable, and as it must be kept up to date.</p>
<p>For the community its also profitable that 2 guys from the community working for Novell (in Nuremberg and in Prague). This provides better communication between &#8220;developers &#8211; community&#8221;. It helps to be closer to the project. This allows you to always be aware of all the major news of the project. And of course the translation is much better if they are engaged not just as a translator, but the employee who works on the distribution.</p>
<p>Of course this also applys for software. Although it is not as important as documentation, it still makes an impression on the quality of distribution. Everyone wants to work with the software in their native language %)</p>
<p>A successful community is a group of people who love openSUSE, who understands why the software should be free, who wants to make openSUSE better and better&#8230; every day.</p>

            <p>The last days I&#8217;ve spent some time to investigate how to package <a href="http://earth.google.com">Google Earth</a> into an rpm.  There was already a script called make-google-package available on the internet, but this one creates a debian package only.  However, it was a good start to get me going to create a Google Earth (GE) rpm.  Although I met quite some obstacles, which is not to uncommon in package building, I was still able to come up with a procedure a get GE packaged.  The biggest problem I encountered were incorrect library dependencies, for which I opened <a href="http://code.google.com/p/earth-issues/issues/detail?id=702">issue 702</a> in the Google Earth issue tracker.  Anyway to make a long story short: the rpm installs Google Earth system wide, corrects file permissions, for openSUSE_11.2 it takes care that the font is rendered correctly, the rpm takes care that Google Earth integrates nicely with the rest of the openSUSE system.</p>
<p>The procedure to build the rpm can be found in the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Google_Earth/rpm">openSUSE wiki</a>.  One word of caution about the procedure, you need to be an experienced linux user and you need to have access to the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Build_Service">openSUSE Build Service</a> (OBS) to be able to build the rpm.  This is due to library dependency problem, which prevents it to build without modification to the base system.</p>
<p>If you like and you have the knowledge how to build an rpm with the tool &#8216;build&#8217;, it would be great if you can extend the howto with steps how to do this (build a GE rpm with &#8216;build&#8217;) to the before mentioned page.  The same is valid for a procedure that uses VirtualBox to build the rpm.</p>
<p>Last but not last; a procedure or even a script, that uses &#8221;&#8217;rpmbuild -ba&#8221;&#8217; to build the rpm, would be very welcom as well.</p>

            <p>Working as a manager sometimes has not so nice days, but tomorrow it will be a really great day. Novell HR has asked me to celebrate a team members ten years anniversary with Novell. That means fun and a present since ten years is a long time, yes, quite a long time for IT industry.</p>
<p><img src="http://en.opensuse.org/images/1/1e/Henne_green_rock.png" alt="Henne Green Rock" align="left" vspace="20">The guy who comes in to S.u.S.E, SuSE and Novell every day since exactly ten years now is <strong><a href="http://en.opensuse.org/User:Hennevogel">Henne</a></strong>. You <em>all</em> know him. He is the guy who helps you with your multimedia problem, the man who finally dries your tears when your package does not build and the one who is first at breakfast after he kicked the last hackers to bed the night before. Of course looking fresh like a new born baby and with the energy of a power plant. Whenever there is work to be done in openSUSE, one can rely on Hennes advice and helping hand.</p>
<p>But that is not all. You might have realized that the openSUSE project is not really ten years old. But maybe it is? Might be that before it was officially set up a few years ago, it was already nested in Hennes heart? He is with openSUSE from day one and before, always following the idea of an open, community driven, vibrant and optimistic openSUSE project with space for opinions, ideas and argues. Over that he never looses focus on a practical compromise that works for all. </p>
<p>He gave very valueable direction in the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Guiding_Principles">Guiding Principle</a> discussion as well as designing the devel project concept in the Build Service which makes external package maintainance possible. Today he gives  important guidance as a member of the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Board">openSUSE Board</a> and is of course one of the strong shoulders in the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Boosters">openSUSE Boosters Team</a>.</p>
<p>I think Henne is one of the persons who make our community valueable and enjoyable. openSUSE is so much benefiting from people like him who take up responsibility and drive things forward.</p>
<p>Henne, in the name of Novell and I guess the whole openSUSE community I like to thank you for all your work so far. I am really looking forward to continuing to do crazy stuff with you. There is a lot more the openSUSE project can achieve over the next couple of decades, great that we have you on board as a green rock <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

            <p><img class="alignright" src="http://planet.fosdem.org/images/faces/fosdem.png" alt="" width="85" height="86" />Just laptop and headphones, book and a bit eat/drink for trip time and of course rube’s cube are in my rucksack <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  On last weekend I was on <a href="http://archive.fosdem.org/2010/">FOSDEM</a>.</p>
<p>FOSDEM is probably the most developer-oriented European Free and Open Source conference/event. As usual it was in Bruxelles, Belgium on first weekend of February. I was there with another Novell/SUSE employees. Majority of they are responsible for work with community. For example, <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Boosters_team">boosters team</a>.</p>
<p>On 5th February we went from Nuremberg at 12 am (by bus) and was in Brussel at 9 pm. At half past ten we (Holgi, Dinar and me) were on the <a href="http://fosdem.org/2010/beerevent">beer event</a>. What can I say about this evening? It was really nice to meet and speak with another developers for a cup of beer <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>The main thing that happens on conferences is learning. This was main reason why I was there and why Novell/SUSE help me to visit FOSDEM. A lot of presentation/talks about KDE, or packaging (RPM), or BuildService or&#8230; a lot about another open source projects&#8230; </p>
<p>I like such events <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  It&#8217;s not only interesting presentations through which you open/learn a lot of new, but also possibility to get acquainted with other developers or is simple with enthusiasts whom it is unconditional as bring the contribution to development free and open source software.</p>
<p>The next evening I have devoted to walk across Bruxelles. It was very interesting to speak with people there. I have made a lot of <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/posix.ru/FOSDEM10#">photos</a>.</p>
<p>For sure, I&#8217;m going to visit FOSDEM in next year, but for next time it will be depends on money. Anyway I will recomend to visit this event for every Linux-/*BSD- user/developer.</p>

            <p>Hello community!</p>
<p>As agreed <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2009/03/06/trying-to-bring-russian-community-together/">at the meeting</a> &#8211; Russian commutiny needs a forum.</p>
<p>Also&#8230; Fixed&#8230; I would like to introduce a new <a href="http://forums.opensuse.org/language-specific-forums/p-russian/">Russian openSUSE forum</a> %)</p>
<p>Right now we have a small problem with encoding and want to add Russian buttons, but it&#8217;s trifle and we will fix it in next days.</p>
<p>In the past Russian community meet on another linux_universal forums like <a href="http://linuxforum.ru">linuxforum.ru</a> or <a href="http://linux.org.ru">linux.org.ru</a>, but these forums are not related to openSUSE project. And now I hope our community gradually will start to join the global.</p>
<p>In this forum we are closer to the draft openSUSE: in the same domain is located and Wiki, and the openSUSE Build Service, and much more.</p>
<p>So&#8230; you are welcome %)</p>

            <p>The openSUSE Project is pleased to announce the release of openSUSE 11.2. After a couple of month good work towards the 11.2 we&#8217;re enjoying a very nice distribution which I already like very much. It is running on most of my machines for a few weeks now. I have already seen some SUSE Linux distros going gold over the time I spent with SUSE and my personal gut feeling tells me this is one of the more remarkable versions.</p>
<p>As usual it comes with tons of new up to date software and also the installation runs smoothly, please read the <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2009/11/12/opensuse-11-2-released/">announcement</a> for all the details,  but what for me the most remarkable with 11.2 is that  it is a real community openSUSE distro.</p>
<p>There is so much effort visible in 11.2 which was achieved through our growing community rather than just the SUSE people. We had a lots of requests in openFATE suggesting features, we discussed some of them quite heated, others were no-brainer. We again had lots of testers who hammered the alphas and betas and reported big and small bugs. On the openSUSE Conference many discussions about the upcoming distribution took place which were inspiring. We were able to utilize the powerful openSUSE Buildservice to build the distro together with all packagers very effectively. That improved the quality of our packages again. Another very visible thing for me personally is the desktop artwork which was done in best cooperation with upstream &#8211; and it looks so great that I hesitate to start applications which cover the desktop all day <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>It is really exciting to see how things come together on the way to community distribution, and how far we got with openSUSE 11.2. I am happy about that and I am proud to be part of this and like to say <strong>thank you</strong> for every little bit you might have contributed. I believe that the message that openSUSE is your community distribution has arrived.</p>
<p>Of course openSUSE continues to be open for your ideas, the distribution can be the vehicle to power up ideas from a little application to huge software projects. The openSUSE project is the powerful community behind which helps to make ideas reality. And all that based on the principles of free software! I am really happy today and very excited about what future will bring <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  </p>
<p>I hope to see you on the release event here in Nürnberg soon <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

            <p>Alright. Just out of curiosity, I felt like finding out what the numbers show for South America compared to other  regions in the Ambassadors Program of openSUSE.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the goals of the Ambassador Program are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Act as an evangelist for openSUSE to the public.</li>
<li>Mentor new users and contributors.</li>
<li>Support openSUSE at local events.</li>
<li>Promote use of openSUSE and contributions to the openSUSE Project.</li>
<li>Have a lot of fun!.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, checking out the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Ambassador/List">Ambassadors List</a>, I got for South America:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brazil = 6.</li>
<li>Chile = 3.</li>
<li>Peru = 3.</li>
<li>Argentina = 2.</li>
<li>Colombia = 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Brazil is doing great here, doubling any other country&#8217;s Ambassadors number in the region. No doubt it&#8217;s not just users who are pushing Open Source out there but also their government and enterprises (example:<a href="www.fisl.org.br/">Fisl</a>), and I am glad openSUSE is a real choice for them. Compared to Europe, I believe statistical numbers are still OK for us <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  since the truth is that openSUSE is just ranked in the top five of the most popular Linux flavours in Chile, maybe it&#8217;s the same in other South America countries. So, Ambassadors for Europe (some countries only):</p>
<ul>
<li>Germany = 8.</li>
<li>Spain = 6.</li>
<li>Austria = 4.</li>
<li>Italy = 3.</li>
<li>France = 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for North America, we have got:</p>
<ul>
<li>USA = 15.</li>
<li>Canada = 3.</li>
<li>Mexico = 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>I even did a &#8220;quick and dirt&#8221; chart with OpenOffice&#8217;s Calc so you can have a graphical idea of our numbers around the world:</p>

<p>Have a lot of fun!.</p>

            <p>Last week I&#8217;ve received an email from Bruce Byfield asking a few questions about this project. I&#8217;ve replied honestly as I would to anyone, I&#8217;ve faced several issues, and it sounded wise to me to hold a bit this. Since the Beta release of Natty that I&#8217;m following a technology forum in Portugal (over 150.000 users) and making a few notes on what peoples perceptions are about Unity and Natty.</p>
<p>From what I see amongst this segment of the Linux users in my country, it&#8217;s interesting&#8230; While legacy users are moving away from Ubuntu to other alternatives seeking GNOME3 (no one seems to be moving from GNOME/Unity to KDE), others are satisfied with Unity. The biggest problem with Natty users so far comes regarding Networking issues and hardware compatibility&#8230; and once more Ubuntu&#8217;s kernels seem to be driving some people to desperation with the classical MCE&#8217;s.</p>
<p>A few days (4 days ago), Compiz 0.9.5 has been released. I&#8217;ve taken a look on the Ubuntu package and the patch level has dropped substantially, which points that upstream has absorbed most of them. Dominique already has 0.9.5 prepared on X11:Compiz (though the version needs a bump on the spec) and I&#8217;m going to test them out and start branching them over to GNOME:Ayatana during the next days and depending on the availability of reviews. This should be peaceful.</p>
<p>For this repository I&#8217;m going to enable a small pattern to provide a simple 1-Click Installer for Compiz alone, this means that people will be able to test the patched version of Compiz in which Unity will be build upon in the future.</p>
<p>After Compiz is established on GNOME:Ayatana, I&#8217;m going to get back to Unity and prepare Unity2D for deployment (being Unity a task for the future).</p>
<p>Now if some people wonder why all of this innactivity? The answer is simple&#8230; GNOME3 was being prepared and launched, and it deserved all the spotlights! Now that GNOME3 has proudly established itself on it&#8217;s segment and despite the press attacks, the communities I keep tracking, I see what seems to be a substantial increase of interest on GNOME3. I would personally consider GNOME3 launch a success.</p>

            <p>around thirty members of the openSUSE project are just back from a fife days visit of <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/2011/">Linuxtag</a> in Berlin, the largest Linux specific event in Europe. We were crowding the openSUSE booth and were giving <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:LinuxTag_Berlin_2011#General_Program">fourteen talks</a>, took part on a key note like <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/2011/de/program/freies-vortragsprogramm/popup/vortragsdetails.html?no_cache=1&#038;talkid=4">panel discussion</a>, the usual distro battle and delivered the well known <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:LinuxTag_Berlin_2011#Booth_Program">Booster workshops</a> on the booth. Here is a little very personal log.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/susebag.jpg"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/susebag-300x264.jpg" alt="A SUSE grafity bag made on LinuxTag 2011" title="susebag" width="300" height="264" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7337" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/susebag-300x264.jpg 300w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/susebag.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>We had a very nice booth, large and at a nice place. We had the chance to tell lots of people about openSUSE and where it is heading to. I heard much good feedback, about the distribution on the one hand, but also for the project and how it evolves. Slowly we seem to get a good message out and users and peers from the FOSS community get and appreciate it. Very good to experience that. </p>
<p>Of course we also had good fun at the booth andgave some interesting workshops in pipe cleaner arts and grafity for example. </p>
<p>Some other specific things that stick to my mind:</p>
<p>I went to a talk about <a href="http://www.icinga.org">Icinga</a>, a system for open source monitoring. A very good talk about an obviously great  system with a very awake community. Good to see the hands on approach of them. Interestingly enough, after the talk somebody asked why they did choose PHP as programming language instead of something cool like rails. I could not resist to tell about that at least I often thought about if it hadn&#8217;t been better to do the OBS in PHP instead of Rails simply because more  people know it. Not appreciated 😉</p>
<p>Another talk I liked was the fly over Qt and its recent past and future, delivered by Daniel Molkentin. Thoughts about Qt 5 were <a href="http://labs.qt.nokia.com/2011/05/09/thoughts-about-qt-5/">published</a> a few weeks ago and Danimo outlined these again, also showing some nice demos of the upcoming Qt Quick and more. </p>
<p>From Vincent I saw a very good talk about collaboration between distros where he came up with an impressive list of activities where we&#8217;re already collaborate and proposals for more. Sad to see only few people in the audience. I missed Vincents other one about GNOME 3, but there is a nice <a href="http://video.golem.de/oss/4817/interview-vincent-untz-ueber-gnome-3.html">Interview</a> with him done at LT about that topic.</p>
<p>Apart from talks I saw <a href="http://community.kde.org/Plasma/Active">KDE Active</a> the first time real on a kind of Weetab on the KDE booth. Definetely cool, hopefully applications will catch up and being ported to this kind of platform. I am sure users will seek out for more than weather forecast apps sooner or later.</p>
<p>On saturday a collegue from the Gentoo Project approached me and told me that his team is actively working on a Smolt feature to also track the list of installed software of a system. We also use Smolt in openSUSE and we also have <a href="https://features.opensuse.org/305877">Feature #305877</a> asking for that kind of functionality, so I think we should jump on that train to support that effort. Nice idea, volunteers welcome!</p>
<p>Yes, and there also was some sports on Linuxtag: The <a href="http://www.ssdev.org/SSDeV/start.php">Sportsfreunde der Sperrtechnik</a> had a booth and were giving workshops on lock picking. I attended, but was not successful so far, need more practising 😉</p>
<p>Apart from that I have to say that I was a bit disappointed by this years LinuxTag. I had the feeling that the number of visitors did not meet the expectations of the most exibitors and presenters. The hallways were really relaxed most of the time. Furthermore, the number of not so impressive talks I saw was comparably high. The official numbers however do not support my feeling, so maybe I am wrong.</p>
<p>Anyway it was big fun again. I like to thank you all for your share which made Linuxtag 2011 a great success for openSUSE.</p>

            <p>Well, have you?  Not the satisfying expulsion of excess gas, but the simplest way you can materially contribute to openSUSE.</p>
<p>I was just hanging in the #active channel, watching my KDE chums make their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA9zaBZysfI">new touchscreen interface</a> (video), when somebody complained that <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/oscaf/files/shared-desktop-ontologies/0.7/">shared-desktop-ontologies</a> does not yet contain the latest release needed by KDE git master.  And instead of updating the package myself, I suggested they just BURP:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branch</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>Update</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>Request</strong>,</li>
<li>the <strong>Package</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And by doing so we all get the latest versions in the devel project and soon in Tumbleweed and openSUSE Factory.  So ambassadors, boosters and motivated contributors know how to do that right?  Now you can use this glib little acronym to persuade friends and colleagues to do the same.</p>
<p>Happy BURPing!</p>

            <p>As Christian Boltz and myself held a quite successful talk on Wine on the 2010 openSUSE conference, we decided to again hold a talk at Germanys largest Linux fair, Linux Tag 2011 in Berlin.</p>
<p>We again ran the pun talk &#8220;Wine&#8221; (not) the Emulator vs &#8220;Wine&#8221; the beverage, with Christian talking about life and work at a vineyard and his wine grower community at Deutsches Weintor.</p>
<p>Included in this talk was a Wine tasting of 4 different kinds of Wine, as grown in the area were Christian lives.</p>
<p>His stories on Vineyard activities and the processing from grape to wine interluded with myself talking about Wine the Emulator, its historical and statistical parts, game support and futures.</p>
<p>Around 70 people  enjoyed our light hearted wrap up talk of this Linux Tag conference.</p>

            <h2>New version of catalyst 11.5 / fglrx 8.850 available</h2>
<p>Please refer to my <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/?p=6680">previous article</a> where all the installation procedure is explained.</p>
<p>At least after a wrong 11.4 version, and a first buggy 11.5 catalyst version, the new one is finally build and ready to install from the repo. Like for 11.3 I&#8217;ve clean up all previous version which are not xpic, so everybody can easily know which drivers he has to install.<br />
I&#8217;ve resigned all rpm with my key. And the tests made show them working.
</p>
<p style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Warning</p>
<p>Some instabilities have been reported. In case of crash like no keyboard, mouse, and blackscreen on reboot. Try to shutdown properly your computer with the shutdown poweroff button. On reboot, just add 3 at the end of grub line to restart in console mode.<br />
Then with yast or zypper you can always try the previous version.

<h3>What about tumbleweed, factory?</h3>
<p>Users have reported that version 8.850 of catalyst 11.5 compile correctly under Tumbleweed with 2.6.38 kernel and the driver is ready for kernel 2.6.39, so until xorg change too much and then AMD support for the new version, installing the 11.4 version should work</p>
<p>For factory, I&#8217;ve build a repository (see previous article) that can be used, and fglrx build</p>

            <p>A few days ago I was wandering on the <a href="http://forums.opensuse.org" target="_blank">openSUSE Forums</a>, once more in the games section when I saw one more post from one of our users asking for <a href="http://www.unknown-horizons.org" target="_blank">Unknown Horizons</a>&#8230; I&#8217;ve search a bit and found 2 entries on OBS (<a href="http://build.opensuse.org" target="_blank">openSUSE Build Service</a>), one for Fedora packages and another for openSUSE packages.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve joined #unknown-horizons on <a href="irc://irc.opensuse.org">FreeNode</a> and found out that Unknown Horizons is very active and people are very nice. I&#8217;ve made a few questions around and offered myself to package this nice game for openSUSE (home:ketheriel:UnknownHorizons). Some of the dependencies are provided by the games repository, to which I want to submit the major releases, and if possible enable builds for Fedora (and friends).</p>
<p>A few packages need some tweaks to enable builds for Fedora (allegro, libenet, guichan), and I&#8217;m working already on that. Meanwhile for everyone who wants to check out the latest development snapshot of Unknown Horizons, feel free to do so&#8230; Currently packaged for:</p>
<p>* openSUSE 11.3<br />
* openSUSE 11.4<br />
* openSUSE Factory<br />
* openSUSE Tumbleweed</p>
<p>The 1-Click installer can be found on <a href="http://www.unknown-horizons.org/download/linux/" target="_blank">Unknown Horizons download page</a>.  There&#8217;s also a nice article (bumping ego) about the new openSUSE packages on Unknown Horizons webpage!</p>
<p>This is a title that all openSUSE users who like RTS games should try (supports openGL and sdl) and is powered by the <a href="http://www.fifengine.de" target="_blank">FIFE Engine</a>.</p>

            <p>Six years ago, when I joined the Novell team&#8217;s office in Cambridge, some of my cohorts in what used to be the Ximian Red Carpet team had an expression: &#8220;Red Hat 7.3 + Ximian Desktop&#8221; &#8211; they sometimes used it to indicate what had been a quantum leap in the Linux Desktop experience of the Gnome Lineage.  Having been personally a vi+terminal kind of guy, and the Konsole being a great terminal multiplexer since times ancient, I had some precise idea of what KDE releases I had particularly appreciated as smoothly integrated (SuSE 6.2 comes to mind), so the expression stuck in my mind as the ultimate paragon of a Gnome setup.  Sure, great things happened since, but the first time you did not have to grease the wheels of every detail for hours to have a smooth environment certainly sticks in your head in a certain indelible way.</p>
<p>openSUSE has been a pretty good Gnome distribution for a long time now, but 11.4 really gave me a different feeling: I found only 1 bug I care to solve in my laptop support, and the defaults I had out of the box were all more than good, they were <em>pleasing</em>.  It is not just functioning well, it is <em>smooth</em>, it has a quality that is hard to describe but we all know it when we see it.  Which is just so damn awesome 🙂</p>
<p>Usually I tinker for days to get an environment I am comfortable with (I am a clinical case, I do this on OS-X, Windows and Linux irrespective), but in this case, I had to do very few things to get a very nice setup for my work laptops, both esthetically and functionally. So here comes my <em>ultimative </em>Gnome quick setup guide to a rocking openSUSE 11.4 Gnome experience.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">F2&#8217;s Quick-Yet-Awesome Gnome Environment Recipe<br />
</span></strong>In no particular order, proceed through the following steps</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pidgin<br />
</strong>su<br />
zypper in pidgin<br />
Make it a Gnome startup application<br />
Control Center | Startup Applications | /usr/bin/pidgin</li>
<li><strong>Flash Player<br />
</strong>Yes, you still need it. Yes, we do love HTML 5 nonetheless.<br />
zypper in flash-player</li>
<li><strong>Glipper<br />
</strong>A clipboard manager, to keep multiple recent cut&amp;paste targets simultaneously at hand.<br />
Head to the <a title="The openSUSE Build Service: Software" href="http://software.opensuse.org/">buildservice</a> and help yourself to a one-click install.<br />
Logout. Log back in. (suggestion of a smarter way to do this would be appreciated)<br />
right click | add to panel | clipboard manager</li>
<li><strong>Gnome Do<br />
</strong>Setup Gnome Do to run at login (it is now in the default install)<br />
gnome-do<br />
preferences | general | start Gnome Do at login<br />
fixing hotkey to ctrl-enter<br />
Select the Glass theme &#8211; matches the openSUSE default theme better on 11.4<br />
I really wish there was a way to have Gnome Do autoclear its buffer after 1 second (or even better when one retypes a similar string), typos are rather defeating in its default mode (&#8220;pidxpidgin&#8221;, anyone?)</li>
<li><strong>Firefox<br />
</strong>Fix Firefox&#8217;s backspace key behavior to match non-Linux platforms (page back) rather than the do-nothing default:<br />
navigate to About:config | browser.backspace_action = 0</li>
<li><strong>Hostname</strong><br />
Set a hostname if DHCP does not do it for you.  No self-respecting terminal monkey would have a random hostname!<br />
YaST | Network Settings | Hostname/DNS</li>
<li><strong>Tilda<br />
</strong>You just cannot overestimate how helpful Quake Terminals are.<br />
<a title="Searching for Tilda" href="http://software.opensuse.org/search?q=tilda&amp;baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.4&amp;lang=en&amp;exclude_debug=true">One click install</a><br />
tilda -C<br />
fix hotkey (keybindings | grab keybinding) to &lt;ctrl&gt;grave<br />
increase buffer (scrolling | Scrollback | 1000)<br />
Now fix the appearance (the defaults work anywhere but they are ghastly-lookin&#8217; 🙂<br />
general | enable Double Buffering [x]<br />
appearance | height | 66%;  width 100%<br />
enable transparency [x] ; Level of transparency 30<br />
enable pulldown [x] ; Delay 15000 usec<br />
use image for background [x]<br />
I use a Gimp-scaled version of the desktop wallpaper there (defaults are in /usr/share/wallpapers)<br />
Make it a Gnome startup application<br />
Control Center | Startup Applications | /usr/bin/tilda</p>
<p>Tilda is the crankier bit (even with all that tuning, it is not yet as smooth as Visor at pulldown, there is still some flickering left).  I am not going to go all-out and say that 2011 is the year of the Linux Desktop, but it sure feels pretty nice an environment to work in, and configuring was quite fast, which means most defaults are better than good.</p>
<p>Suggestions, corrections and additional ideas are welcome. Ramble on, I am reading!</li>

            <p>It was brought to my attention through I <a href="http://karl-tux-stadt.de/ktuxs/?p=3176" target="_blank">article</a> (german) the existence of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gpick/" target="_blank">gpick</a>, an advanced and high featured color picker. I&#8217;ve taken a quick look at it to make it available for openSUSE as it seems an interesting tool for artists and web designers (maybe GTK3+ themers) and others.</p>
<p>To build this package a few files are generated with the <a href="http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/" target="_blank">Lemon Parser Generator</a> which isn&#8217;t really available. I&#8217;m contacting upstream regarding the possibility of including the generated files in the tarball, or eventually if that fails, I&#8217;ll probably need to include lemon.c, hand compile it and hack scons build to use the local binary to generate those files.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The screenshots have a tiny glitch on an icon, this is mainly because I haven&#8217;t rebuilt the icon cache when I took them. I look forward to explore the possibility of having such a great tool available for openSUSE 12.1.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I&#8217;ve made available a small test package on <strong><a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Aketheriel%3Agpick" target="_blank">home:ketheriel:gpick</a></strong> (needs some work before submitting to factory) which should be working. Any testing/feedback will be most welcomed. Also enabled builds for Fedora 14, since I believe this package isn&#8217;t available for Fedora.</p>

            <p>Yesterday I&#8217;ve seen in facebook a few photos by Chuck Payne from the Marketing team showing his collection of SuSE materials&#8230; I do have a few &#8216;vintage&#8217; items as well&#8230; Back in 98 when I tried SuSE Linux 5.3 for the first time, it was somehow expensive to burn DVD&#8217;s and I was hanging around on a 56K line back then, so pulling them over the internet was not really an option.</p>
<div id="attachment_7279" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSCN0004.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7279 " src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSCN0004.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="601" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSCN0004.jpg 700w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSCN0004-244x300.jpg 244w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Original SuSE Linux 6.0 box</p></div>
<p>I liked a lot my first Linux experiences, so still hanging on a 56K modem, I&#8217;ve decided to purchase SuSE Linux 6.0 box edition from a Linux reseller in Lisbon. I still remember the thrill of picking up the package at the post office and rushing home to try out my Linux distribution of choice (Red Hat 5.1 didn&#8217;t last for long). I&#8217;m also happy to say that this box provided my first Linux book, the awesome manual provided with it. I&#8217;ve ended up using it for years.</p>
<div id="attachment_7280" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSCN0005.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7280 " src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSCN0005.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="585" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSCN0005.jpg 700w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSCN0005-251x300.jpg 251w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Original SuSE Linux 6.1</p></div>
<p>SuSE 6.0 started a tradition and the swap to 2.2.x kernel made me purchase once more the latest release of my preferred Linux distribution. Still enslaved with a 56K modem link, after a pleasant 6.0 experience, this became a must in the old &#8216;internet warrior&#8217; days.</p>
<div id="attachment_7281" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSCN0006.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7281 " src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSCN0006.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="653" srcset="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSCN0006.jpg 700w, https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/DSCN0006-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">original SuSE Linux 6.2 CD&#039;s</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;ve also purchased SuSE Linux 6.2, unfortunatly I only have the CD case and the media itself from this release&#8230; The box and the manual probably were lost during the &#8216;Great Purge&#8217; or lie around in a on old box in the attic&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I haven&#8217;t found them&#8230; but this is a nice souvenir 🙂</p>

<p>SuSE Linux 6.4 was the last SuSE release I&#8217;ve bought&#8230; at this time I had already cable available and wasn&#8217;t living anymore under the 56K nightmare&#8230; at work I also had a 2Mbit line available and pulling out stuff was not an issue&#8230; This was the 2nd release which featured a graphical installer (implemented on 6.3 I think)&#8230;.</p>
<p>I also own a SuSE Linux 7.0 original box though I didn&#8217;t purchased it. In February 2001 I&#8217;ve organized a Linux event in Aveiro which was sponsored by SuSE Linux which sent a huge crate containing:</p>
<p>* 7 Original Boxes of SuSE Linux 7.0;<br />
* 20 SuSE Linux T-shirts (10 in black, 10 in white);<br />
* Around 100 &#8216;newspaper&#8217; style SuSE Linux edition in english;<br />
* Two huge stacks (maybe around 100 in total) Live CD&#8217;s;<br />
* 7 Tux plush penguins (maybe 10, I don&#8217;t recall for sure);<br />
* 10 SuSE Linux baseball caps (I had one, also lost in the Great Purge);<br />
* A huge load of stickers and pins (I still have a 10 year old pin from this date with the original packaging/seal)</p>
<p>Red Hat provided for this event around 50 stickers, Sun Microsystems provided 400/500 Star Office 5.1 official media! All this goods were distributed during the event from which sadly I don&#8217;t possess photos anymore. It took place in the Cultural Congress Center of Aveiro with the support of Aveiro City Hall and local hardware manufacturer (who payed the bills). We had 3 national linux resellers from SuSE, Red Hat, Debian and Slackware present. The event was a 2 day mega LIP (Linux Install Party) and show Linux room featuring KDE, GNOME, hardware support and multimedia capabilities.</p>

<p>This was one of the nicest features of buying a box edition (besides the stickers and media). SuSE Linux shipped always with very elegant boxes with awesome polygons (the boxes are actually very nicely manufactured). This manual was like a field manual for a powerful Linux experience&#8230; the day saver for starters and professionals. This is one of the reasons why I still advice newcomers to buy openSUSE boxed sets! The value presented on this editions is something really worth the money.</p>
<p>For as much strange as this might sound&#8230; I&#8217;ve bought more SuSE Software than any other proprietary OS, in fact I only own a copy of Windows NT4.0 Workstation and a OEM License of Windows 7 (bundled with the laptop). Excepting console games, I&#8217;ve never payed for so much software as I did to SuSE GmbH!</p>
<p>Only missing the cherry on the top of cake! Do you have one of this on your laptop ?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why&#8230; just felt like sharing this old vintage stuff&#8230; I am proud to continue using openSUSE, which in my humble opinion delievers the same value that once SuSE Linux provided me! I am also proud to give a bit of my time to package one or another package and improve openSUSE, which also makes me feel like a part of this Linux distribution, something I would never image when I purchased those boxes!</p>
<p>My great thanks to everyone who worked on those releases and is still around! A testimony that your work was enjoyed and appreciated!</p>

            <p>For quite some time we had a package named ec2-api-tools in the Cloud:EC2 project and I suspect many that work with EC2 had found the package and were using the ec2-* commands to manage stuff in EC2. Along with the ec2-api-tools Amazon maintained a separate ec2-* tool set for various services. Keeping up with the armada of Amazon developers is not easy and thus the other ec2-* tool sets never got packaged.</p>
<p>Now a new integrated set of tools is available called with the &#8220;aws&#8221; command and provided by the aws-cli package. The package is available from the Cloud:Tools project and a submit request to Factory is pending. The new package does not obsolete the ec2-api-tools package as there is no issue with having both packages installed. However, I did take the liberty to remove the ec2-api-tool package from the Cloud:EC2 project as it would no longer receive updates considering that we have a nice new tool that unifies all Amazon services. The documentation for the new command can be found <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cli/" title="here"></a>.</p>
<p>The aws code is hosted on github and thus contribution of fixes is easy and that is another big plus over the ec2-* tool sets.</p>
<p>Yes, and of course we need to get openSUSE 13.1 into EC2, and I am working on that, stay tuned&#8230;.</p>

            <p>In our <a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/2014/02/07/some-news-from-the-trenches/">previous summary</a>, we talked about some basic research and some ground work to build on. This time we have some first exciting results!</p>
<h3>openQA</h3>
<p>Last week we rearranged the repository a little bit, creating a <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/openQA/tree/devel">new branch called &quot;devel&quot;</a> where all the exciting (and not so exciting) changes are taking place. Our little Factory <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>The main difference between this branch as master is that, as you could read in the previous blog, the devel branch is openQA build on <a href="http://mojolicio.us">Mojolicious</a>, a nice web development framework. And having a proper web framework is starting to show its benefits: we have openID login available! Unfortunately the current openSUSE openID provider is a little bit weird, so it doesn&#8217;t play well with our tool yet, but some others are working and openSUSE accounts will be the next step. Having working user accounts is necessary to be able to start defining permissions and to make openQA truly multiuser. And to be able to deploy the new version on a public server!</p>
<p>The other main focus of this week has been internal polishing. We have revamped the database layout and changed the way in which the different openQA components communicate with each other. The openQA functionality is spread out over several parts: the workers are responsible of actually executing the tests in virtual machines reporting the result after every execution; some client utilities are used to load new ISO images and similar tasks and, finally, we have the one openQA Server to rule them all. Until now, the communication between the server and the other components was done using <a href="http://json-rpc.org/">JSON-RPC</a> (a lightweight alternative to XML-RPC). We have dropped JSON-RPC in favor of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST-like</a> API with just JSON over plain HTTP. This change allowed us to implement exactly the same functionality in a way that is simpler, perfectly supported by any web framework, natively spoken by browsers and easier to authenticate (using, for example, plain HTTP authentication or openID). This is also the first step to future integration with other services (think OBS, as the ultimate goal is to use openQA to test staging projects).</p>
<p>But, who tests the tester? openQA is growing and changing quite fast so we have continued with the task of creating a good testing infrastructure to tests openQA itself to make sure that all our changes do not result in breakage. We only have a few tests right now, but we now have a solid foundation to write more and more tests.</p>
<h3>Staging and package manipulation</h3>
<p>In the last blog post we told you we were investigating a code test suite to test the abilities of a osc plugin we are writing. osc is the commandline tool for handling the Open Build Service, and this plugin is meant to help with the administration of staging projects. We&#8217;ve been thinking about how to move forward with the testing part as we want to make sure the functionality works as advertised. More important, we write tests to make sure that our additions and changes do not break existing functionality. We have started merging functionality from various scripts handling staging thingies and rings we had into this plugin. This is partially done so we can do basic staging project tasks! We can take a request (be it submit or delete) and put it to test in a staging project. We can also move packages between staging projects and we have a simple YAML in project descriptions to indicate what packages and what requests are there.</p>
<p><a href="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/openqa-staging.png"><img src="//lizards.opensuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/openqa-staging-300x102.png" alt="We're all green!" width="250" height="85" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10576" /></a><br />
Coolo already started using the plugin for some tasks, so you can <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/subprojects/openSUSE:Factory:Staging">see pretty titles</a> and <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/openSUSE:Factory:Staging:C">metadata</a> in staging projects descriptions. Not impressive enough? Let me provide you a good headline:</p>
<p><b>Thanks to staging projects, no single regression have been introduced this year in the core of Factory</b></p>
<p>You can enjoy a more detailed description in <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2014-02/msg00252.html">this announcement</a> written by coolo to the Factory mailing list and have some visual joy in the included screenshot (genuine pr0n for QA engineers).</p>
<p>Last but not least, we also did some cleanup of the sources in the repo and of course we added more tests (as functionality grows). And there has been work on other parts of the plugin, like taking rings into account.</p>
<h3>Result</h3>
<p>We already have some useful functionality which we are going to expand and build on. Not that much to show yet, but we are progressing towards our goal. You can follow our progress either in the way of tasks (<a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqav3">openQA</a> and <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/stagings">staging projects</a>) or just follow our commit history on github (again for both <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/openQA/tree/devel">openQA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory">staging plugin</a>).</p>
<p>We are very much looking forward to feedback and thoughts &#8211; these changes aim to make Factory development easier and thus we need to hear from all you!</p>

            <p>Today I like to take you precious time to talk about thing that get so less attention in open source world. I like to talk little bit about QA and Coding guidelines.<br />
Many reader who are in companies that take care of themselves or are involved some major open source or free software project like KDE, GNOME or Linux kernel knows that they/we have Coding guidelines. KDE have it <a href="http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Kdelibs_Coding_Style" title="KDE code guidelines">here</a> and Kernel have it <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle" title="Kernel code guidelines">here</a>.

            <p>I&#8217;ve been seeking cloud storage of my life for long time now. My needs are not much (but most of the time they are too big as I have learned) only space and if possible Linux/Mac OS X FUSE for using service.<br />
Service being open source or not isn&#8217;t such big thing in this case. How data is stored (crypted or not) and how can I get them out there if I need them is what I treasure most.<br />
I have tested <a href="https://spideroak.com/" title="SpideOak">SpiderOak</a>, <a href="https://spideroak.com" title="Wuala">Wuala</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" title="Dropbox">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://www.box.com/" title="Box">box.net</a> but non of them fits for my needs perfectly. As I want to use these services with Linux all of them have Linux clients and most of them have FUSE-filesystem. Lately I have been using Wuala but it has problem that FUSE stuff is written in Java (it works under openSUSE just fine!). With GUI it&#8217;s clean and like said works very well but then comes but if you don&#8217;t want to use GUI you are in little bit trouble. It&#8217;s supported but I haven&#8217;t got it working. Xvfb comes to rescue but still it&#8217;s not really a solution!<br />
When I heard about <a href="https://secure.elfcloud.fi/" title="elfcloud.fi">Elfcloud.fi</a> I though okay we have some storage provider in Finland no big deal. I just popped their web site and noticed that they are really open source friendly company. They <a href="https://github.com/elfCLOUD/elfcloud-weasel" title="Elfcloud.fi weasel">have Github Python-library</a> (Apache Version 2.0 licensed) and full <a href="https://secure.elfcloud.fi/en/developers/api-doc/" title="Elfcloud.fi API docs">API documentation which is dead simple JSON</a> stuff also their pricing scheme ain&#8217;t that bad. I have mention that this is hardcore crypto cloud service. If you lose your key you can wave goodbye to you data. Best of all they gonna have marvelous FUSE implementation as I&#8217;m writing it currently (They also have C++ library available on request. Apache Version 2.0 licensed of course).<br />
So if you want to keep your data on Europe and have it stored in same country that have also is also trusted by Google datacenters and Microsoft you can check out elfcloud.fi. It&#8217;s not for everyone for sure but those who are in same need place to store data without hustle this can be the stuff for you. </p>
<p>You can download python API RPM from here: <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/illuusio:/elfcloud/" title="Elfcloud rpms">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/illuusio:/elfcloud/</a></p>

            <p>If you have used a cloud, that was based on OpenStack, you will have seen the dashboard including a web-based VNC access using noVNC + WebSockets.<br />
However, it was not possible to access this VNC directly (e.g. with my favourite gvncviewer from the gtk-vnc-tools package), because the actual compute nodes are hidden and accessing them would circumvent authentication, too.</p>
<p>I want this for the option to add an OpenStack-backend to openQA, my OS-autotesting framework, which emulates a user by using a few primitives: grabbing screenshots and typing keys (can be done through VNC), powering up a machine(=nova boot), inserting/ejecting an installation medium (=nova volume-attach / volume-detach).</p>
<p>To allow for this, I wrote a small perl script, that translates a TCP-connection into a WebSocket-connection.<br />
It is installed like this<br />
<code>git clone https://github.com/bmwiedemann/connectionproxy.git<br />
sudo /sbin/OneClickInstallUI http://multiymp.zq1.de/perl-Protocol-WebSocket?base=http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:languages:perl</code></p>
<p>and is used like this<br />
<code>nova get-vnc-console $YOURINSTANCE novnc<br />
perl wsconnectionproxy.pl --port 5942 --to http://cloud.example.com:6080/vnc_auto.html?token=73a3e035-cc28-49b4-9013-a9692671788e<br />
gvncviewer localhost:42</code></p>
<p>I hope this neat code will be useful for other people and tasks as well and wish you a lot of fun with it.</p>
<p>Some technical details:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code is able to handle multiple connections in a single thread using select.</li>
<li>HTTPS is not supported in the code, but likely could be done with stunnel.</li>
<li>WebSocket-code was written in 3h.</li>
<li>noVNC tokens expire after a few minutes.</li>
</ul>

          </div>
          
          <div class="entry">
            <p>As you might know, we are focusing our development efforts in two fronts, namely <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2014-01/msg00317.html">openQA</a> and <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2014-01/msg00278.html">staging projects</a>. As we just started we don&#8217;t have fireworks for you (yet) but we did some solid ground work that we are going to build upon.</p>
<h3>Working on openQA</h3>
<p>We are organizing our daily job in openQA into highly focused sprints of two weeks. The focus of the first sprint was clear: cleanup the current codebase to empower future development and lower the entry barrier for casual contributors, which can be translated as &#8220;cleaning our own mess&#8221;. We created <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/67">some tasks in progress</a>, grouped in a version with a surprising and catchy name: Sprint 01.</p>
<h4>Got my mojo workin&#8217;</h4>
<p>Up to now, openQA web interface was written using just a bunch of custom CGI scripts and some configuration directives in Apache. We missed a convenient way to access to all the bell and whistles of modern web development and some tools to make the code more readable, reliable and easier to extend and test. In short, we missed a proper web development framework. We evaluated the most popular Perl-based alternatives and we finally decided to go for <a href="http://mojolicio.us/">Mojolicious</a> for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides all the functionality we demand from a web framework while being lightweight and unbloated.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s stated as a &#8220;real time framework&#8221; which, buzzwords apart, means that is designed from the ground to fully support Comet (long-polling), EventSource and WebSockets. Very handy technologies for implementing some features in openQA.</li>
<li>It really &#8220;feels&#8221; very close to <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>, which makes Ruby on Rails     developers feel like at home. And we have quite some Rails developers hanging around, don&#8217;t we? Just think about OBS, software.o.o, WebYast, progress.o.o, OSEM, the TSP app&#8230;
<li>Mojolicious motto is &#8220;web development can be fun again&#8221;. Who could resist to that?</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ve now reached the end of the sprint and we already have something that looks exactly the same than what we had before, but using Mojolicious internally. We are very happy with the framework and we are pretty confident that future development of openQA will be easier and faster than ever. OpenQA has mojo!</p>
<h4>The database layer in openQA</h4>
<p>Another part that we worked on during first sprint was the database layer. The user interface part of openQA use a SQLite database to store the jobs and workers registered in the system. The connection between the code and the database was expressed directly in SQL using a simple API.</p>
<p>We have replaced this layer with another equivalent that uses an ORM (Object-relational mapping) in Perl (<a href="http://www.dbix-class.org/">DBIx::Class</a>). Every data model in openQA is now a true object that can be created, copied and moved between the different layers of the application. Quite handy.</p>
<p>To make sure we don&#8217;t forget anything, we created a bunch of tests covering the whole functionality of the original code, running this test suite after each step of the migration. In this way we have achieved two goals: we now have a simple way to share and update information through the whole system and we can migrate very easily to a different database engine (something that we plan to do in the future).</p>
<h3>What to do with staging</h3>
<p>Over the time, coolo had accumulated quite some scripts that helped him with Factory. Most of them are actually related to something we are doing right now: the staging projects. So in the end we basically migrated all relevant ones to <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory">github</a> and one by one we are merging their functionality to staging plugin. We also experimented with test frameworks that we could use to test the plugin itself, selected few and we even have a first test! The final plan is to have the whole plugin functionality covered with a proper test suite, so we will know when something breaks. Currently, there is a lot of mess in our repo and the plugin itself need big cleanup, but we are working on it.</p>
<h3>Contributions are welcome</h3>
<p>If you want to help but wonder where to start, we identified tasks that are good to dive into the topic and named them &#8220;easy hacks&#8221;: mostly self contained tasks we expect to have little effort but we lack the time to do right now. Just jump over the list for <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/73">openQA</a> or <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/versions/69">staging projects</a>.</p>
<p>For grabbing the code related to staging project, you only need to clone the <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/osc-plugin-factory">already mentioned repository</a>. The openQA code is spread in several repositories (<a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst">one</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/openQA">two</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse">three</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE-Team/os-autoinst-needles-opensuse">four</a>), but setting up your own instance to play and hack is a piece of cake using <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/package/openQA">the packages</a> available in OBS (built automatically for every git push).</p>
<p>If you simply want to see what we are doing in more detail, take a look at progress.o.o, we have both <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/openqav3">openQA</a> and <a href="https://progress.opensuse.org/projects/stagings">Staging projects</a> there.</p>
<p>We are having a lot of fun, and we encourage you to join us!</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Lately there was some confusion regarding our communication. We, at the <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:OpenSUSE_team">openSUSE Team@SUSE</a> are deeply aware that our communication needs to be improved. So in the hope to make everything clear again, here is the summary to clear up what is really going on and what was not happening.</p>
<h3>Long story short:</h3>
<ul>
<li>There <strong>WILL</strong> be openSUSE 13.2 in November 2014</li>
<li>13.2 <strong>WILL</strong> have security and maintenance support provided by SUSE</li>
<li>We <strong>WILL</strong> have coolo as release manager for 13.2</li>
<li>SUSE is <strong>NOT decreasing</strong> manpower put into openSUSE</li>
<li>Everybody from the community is welcome and encouraged to be involved with, and if they want to, take over some parts of the release process and we will support you the best we can in doing that</li>
</ul>
<h3>Now for the long story.</h3>
<p>Our team and only our team &#8211; openSUSE@SUSE &#8211; is going to work on improving &#8216;tooling&#8217; side of the openSUSE project until August. These changes will benefit openSUSE by making it easier to produce better releases in the future.</p>
<p>Nothing changes for the rest of SUSE. SUSE is not abandoning openSUSE. The rest of SUSE will still do the same things they were doing until now and continue to keep openSUSE awesome. This includes Maintenance, Security, Infrastructure, and many other teams besides the openSUSE Team at SUSE who actively support the openSUSE project.</p>
<h3>What is our plan?</h3>
<p>Our plan is to make sure that future openSUSE releases are easier for everyone to produce. As we grow we could keep putting in more and more full-time release managers (if we find them somewhere), but this approach is probably unsustainable and, more importantly, goes against our desire to empower the community to do more as part of openSUSE.</p>
<p>Therefore, we decided to improve our tools to ensure that making a release is much more straightforward and reliable and we can reduce and distribute the workload needed for integration and release. To make this happen we need time and everyone from the team to work on adapting the tooling side. We also would welcome volunteers to help us with tools and with the following release(s).</p>
<p>With the release date now set in November (mirroring roadmap for 13.1), first milestone should be released in May. That is a perfect oportunity to go to openSUSE Conference in Croatia where we can meet up, gather volunteers to help and discuss how to work. Remember that openSUSE Travel Support is in place to sponsor everyone who needs financial help to get to the event.</p>
<p>Hopefully now we cleared things up a little and we are really sorry again for our poor communication &#8211; We&#8217;re going to work on it.</p>

            <p>As we stated in our communication over the time, our team&#8217;s main focus for foreseeable future is Factory and how to manage all those contributions. Goal is <strong>not</strong> to increase the number of SRs that is coming to Factory, but to make sure we can process more and to make sure we see even well hidden consequences to make sure that Factory is &#8220;stable&#8221; and &#8220;usable&#8221;.</p>

<p>Not really part of our current sprints, but something that will hopefully help us is <i>spec-cleaner</i> that Tomáš Chvátal and Tomáš Čech were working on lately during their free time/hackweek. What is it trying to address? Currently, there are some packaging guidelines, but when you write a spec file for your software, you still have plenty of choices. How do you order all the information in the header? Do you use curly brackets around macros? Do you use macros? Which ones do you use and which not? Do you use binaries in dependencies? Package config? Perl symbols? Package names? There is <i>format_spec_file</i> obs service that tries to unify a little bit the coding style but leaves quite some of the stuff up to you. Not necessarily a bad thing, but if you have to compare changes and review packages that are using completely different coding styles the process becomes harder and slower.</p>
<p><i>spec-cleaner</i> is <i>format_spec_file</i> taken to another level. It tries to unify coding style as much as it can. It uses consistent conventions, makes most of the decisions mentioned previously for you and if you already decided for one way in the past, it will try to convert your spec file to follow the conventions that it specifies. It&#8217;s not enforcing anything, it&#8217;s standalone script and therefore you don&#8217;t have to be worried that you spec file will be out of your control. You can run it, verify the result (actually, you should verify the results as there might still be some bugs) and commit it to OBS. If we all do it, our packages will all look more alike and it will be easier to read and review them.</p>
<p>How to try it? How to help? Well, code is on <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/spec-cleaner">GitHub</a> and packages are in <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Tools/spec-cleaner">OBS</a>. You may have a version of it in your distribution, but that one is heavily outdated (even the 13.1 version), so add openSUSE:Tools repo and try the version from there.</p>
<pre>zypper ar -f obs://openSUSE:Tools/openSUSE_13.1 openSUSE-Tools
zypper in spec-cleaner</pre>
<p>You can then go to some local checkout and try what changes does it propose for your spec file. Easiest way is to just let it do stuff by calling it and taking a look at changes afterwards.</p>
<pre>spec-cleaner -p -i *.spec
osc diff</pre>
<p>If it works, great, we will have more unified spec files. If it doesn&#8217;t, file a  <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/spec-cleaner/issues">bug</a> <img src="https://lizards.opensuse.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

            <p>The x86_64 edition of openSUSE Education&#8217;s <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Education-Li-f-e" title="Li-f-e">Li-f-e</a> live DVD supports PXE booting the iso over the network, here is how to do it:</p>
<p>* Install Li-f-e (Switch to GRUB from Installation Summary page if your hardware does not support EFI boot ), make sure you have plenty of space assigned to / partition(about 20G)<br />
* Set up LTSP by following this <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:LTSP%20quick%20start%2012.2%20Edu" title="LTSP Quick Start">quick start guide</a><br />
* Create /srv/nfs folder and copy Li-f-e iso there<br />
* Run the following as root in terminal:<br />
<code><br />
mount /srv/nfs/openSUSE-Edu-li-f-e.x86_64-13.1.1.iso /mnt<br />
cp /mnt/boot/x86_64/loader/linux /srv/tftpboot/boot/linux-life64<br />
cp /mnt/boot/x86_64/loader/initrd /srv/tftpboot/boot/initrd-life64<br />
echo "/srv/nfs *(ro,no_root_squash,async,no_subtree_check)" &gt;&gt; /etc/exports<br />
cat &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;&gt; /srv/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default<br />
LABEL Li-f-e<br />
kernel boot/linux-life64<br />
append initrd=boot/initrd-life64 isofrom_device=nfs:10.0.0.254:/srv/nfs/ isofrom_system=/openSUSE-Edu-li-f-e.x86_64-13.1.1.iso nonm<br />
IPAPPEND 2<br />
EOF<br />
chkconfig rpcbind on &amp;&amp; service rpcbind restart<br />
chkconfig nfsserver on &amp;&amp; service nfsserver restart<br />
</code><br />
Now you can PXE boot any machine over the network, select Li-f-e from the end of the boot menu to boot live DVD iso instead of normal LTSP session.</p>
<p>Please note that if you install Li-f-e booted over the network then after the installation  you will need to remove &#8220;nonm&#8221; boot option using yast2 bootloader to get NetworkManager working again.</p>
